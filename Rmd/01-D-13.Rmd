# Irradiated Components {-}

This section covers **Irradiated Blood Components**, a critical modification performed to prevent a rare but devastating complication of transfusion: Transfusion-Associated Graft-versus-Host Disease (TA-GVHD)

## **What is Irradiation of Blood Components?** {-}

*   **Definition:** The process of exposing cellular blood components (Red Blood Cells, Platelets, Granulocytes, Whole Blood) to a measured dose of ionizing radiation (gamma rays or X-rays) before transfusion
*   **Mechanism:** The radiation damages the DNA of **donor T-lymphocytes** present within the blood component. This renders these lymphocytes incapable of proliferating (dividing and multiplying) after being transfused into the recipient
*   **Goal:** To prevent viable donor T-lymphocytes from engrafting in the recipient, multiplying, and attacking the recipient's tissues (TA-GVHD)
*   **Important Distinction:** Irradiation does **NOT** sterilize the blood product; it does not kill bacteria, viruses, or parasites. Its sole purpose is to inactivate donor T-lymphocytes

## **Why Irradiate? The Threat of TA-GVHD** {-}

*   **Transfusion-Associated Graft-versus-Host Disease (TA-GVHD):** This is a rare but usually **fatal** complication of transfusion
    *   **Pathophysiology:** It occurs when viable donor T-lymphocytes are transfused into a recipient who cannot recognize or eliminate them. These donor lymphocytes engraft, proliferate, and mount an immune attack against the recipient's "foreign" tissues (skin, liver, gut, bone marrow)
    *   **Risk Factors:** TA-GVHD is more likely when:
        1.  The recipient is significantly **immunocompromised** (e.g., congenital immunodeficiencies, hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, patients receiving intense chemotherapy/immunosuppression)
        2.  The donor and recipient share **HLA haplotypes** (genetic markers for the immune system), making it harder for the recipient's immune system to recognize the donor lymphocytes as foreign. This is particularly relevant in **directed donations from blood relatives** (parents, siblings, children)
*   **Prevention:** Since TA-GVHD is difficult to treat and often fatal, prevention through irradiation of cellular components for at-risk recipients is the standard of care

## **Indications for Irradiation (Who Needs Irradiated Blood?)** {-}

Irradiation is indicated for patients whose immune systems may be unable to eliminate transfused donor lymphocytes or when there's an increased risk of shared HLA types:

*   **Severely Immunocompromised Patients**
    *   Congenital immunodeficiency syndromes (e.g., SCID)
    *   Hematopoietic Progenitor Cell (HPC) / Stem Cell Transplant recipients (both autologous and allogeneic)
    *   Patients receiving intense immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., certain chemotherapy regimens, anti-thymocyte globulin)
    *   Patients with Hodgkin lymphoma
*   **Fetal and Neonatal Transfusions**
    *   Intrauterine transfusions
    *   Neonatal exchange transfusions
    *   Premature infants (especially low birth weight) - policies vary, but often irradiated
*   **Directed Donations from Blood Relatives:** **Mandatory** for first- or second-degree relatives due to the increased likelihood of shared HLA haplotypes
*   **HLA-Matched Components:** If components (especially platelets) are specifically selected to be HLA-matched for a recipient, irradiation is required because the recipient's immune system may not recognize the donor lymphocytes as foreign
*   **Granulocyte Transfusions:** **Mandatory** due to the high number of viable lymphocytes present

**Note** Policies may vary slightly between institutions, but these represent the core indications

## **The Irradiation Process** {-}

*   **Equipment:** Performed using a dedicated **blood irradiator**. These devices contain either:
    *   A radioactive source (commonly Cesium-137 or Cobalt-60) emitting gamma rays
    *   An X-ray generating system
*   **Dose:** The standard required dose is:
    *   **25 Gray (Gy):** delivered to the central portion of the unit
    *   A minimum dose of **15 Gy** delivered to any other part of the unit
*   **Verification:** An **irradiation indicator label** is usually affixed to the unit before irradiation. This label undergoes a visible color change upon exposure to the required radiation dose, providing visual confirmation that the process was performed

## **Which Components Are Irradiated?** {-}

Irradiation is necessary only for components containing significant numbers of viable T-lymphocytes:

*   **Red Blood Cells (RBCs)**
*   **Platelets:** (Whole Blood Derived and Apheresis)
*   **Granulocytes:** (Mandatory for all units)
*   **Whole Blood**

**Components NOT Requiring Irradiation**

These components are essentially acellular or contain non-viable lymphocytes:

*   Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP)
*   Plasma Frozen within 24 hours (PF24)
*   Cryoprecipitated AHF
*   Cryoprecipitate-Reduced Plasma
*   Plasma Fractionation Products (Albumin, IVIG, Factor Concentrates)

## **Impact of Irradiation on Components (Especially RBCs)** {-}

While necessary for safety, irradiation does have effects, particularly on Red Blood Cells:

*   **RBC Membrane Damage:** The radiation causes some damage to the RBC membrane
*   **Increased Potassium Leakage:** This membrane damage leads to an accelerated rate of potassium (K+) leaking from the RBCs into the supernatant plasma/additive solution
*   **Potentially Reduced Viability:** May slightly decrease the 24-hour post-transfusion survival of RBCs, though usually still well above the acceptable minimum
*   **Impact on Expiration Date (CRITICAL):** Due to the increased potassium leak and potential impact on viability, the expiration date of **irradiated Red Blood Cells** is changed:
    *   The unit expires on the **original expiration date** OR **28 days from the date of irradiation**, **WHICHEVER COMES FIRST**
    *   *Example 1:* An RBC unit with a 42-day original expiry is irradiated on Day 10. Its new expiry date is Day 10 + 28 days = Day 38 (sooner than the original Day 42)
    *   *Example 2:* An RBC unit with a 42-day original expiry is irradiated on Day 30. Its new expiry date is Day 30 + 28 days = Day 58, BUT the original expiry is Day 42. So, the unit expires on Day 42 (whichever is sooner)
*   **Platelets:** Irradiation has minimal impact on platelet function or storage. The **original 5-day (or 7-day) expiration date is retained** for irradiated platelets

## **Storage and Expiration (Post-Irradiation)** {-}

*   **RBCs:** Store at 1-6°C. Expiry is original date OR 28 days post-irradiation, whichever is sooner. Must check the label carefully!
*   **Platelets:** Store at 20-24°C with agitation. Original 5- or 7-day expiry applies
*   **Granulocytes:** Store at 20-24°C without agitation. Original 24-hour expiry applies

## **Administration** {-}

*   No special administration procedures are required specifically *because* a unit is irradiated
*   Standard procedures apply: ABO/Rh compatibility, crossmatch (for RBCs/Granulocytes), standard blood filter, infusion within 4 hours

## **Key Terms** {-}

*   **Irradiation:** Treatment with ionizing radiation (gamma or X-rays)
*   **TA-GVHD (Transfusion-Associated Graft-versus-Host Disease):** Complication where donor T-lymphocytes attack recipient tissues
*   **T-Lymphocyte:** Type of white blood cell responsible for cell-mediated immunity; inactivated by irradiation
*   **Immunocompromised:** Having a weakened immune system
*   **HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigen):** Immune system markers on cells; shared haplotypes increase TA-GVHD risk in related donors
*   **Gray (Gy):** Unit of absorbed radiation dose
*   **Blood Irradiator:** Device used to irradiate blood components

# Lewis {-}

The **Lewis blood group system (ISBT 007)** is fascinating because, unlike ABO or Rh, Lewis antigens aren't manufactured *by* the red blood cell itself. Instead, they are soluble **carbohydrate antigens** found in plasma and secretions that **passively adsorb** onto the red cell membrane. This system is intricately linked with the Secretor system (*FUT2* gene) and ABO genetics, with the interplay between the Lewis (*FUT3*) and Secretor (*FUT2*) fucosyltransferase enzymes determining whether **Le<sup>a</sup>** or **Le<sup>b</sup>** antigens are formed on Type 1 precursor chains

## **Genetics: Two Key Players (*FUT3* and *FUT2*)** {-}

The expression of Lewis antigens depends on the interplay of two genes, both located on chromosome 19:

*  **Lewis Gene (*FUT3* or *Le*)**
    *   Codes for an enzyme called **α-1,4-L-fucosyltransferase:** (sometimes written as Fucosyltransferase 3 or FucT-III)
    *   **Function:** Adds a fucose sugar to the N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residue of **Type 1 precursor chains**
    *   **Alleles**
        *   ***Le***: Functional allele, produces the enzyme
        *   ***le***: Amorph (non-functional) allele, common mutation results in no active enzyme. *le* is recessive to *Le*

*  **Secretor Gene (*FUT2* or *Se*):** (We discussed this with ABO secretions)
    *   Codes for an enzyme called **α-1,2-L-fucosyltransferase:** (Fucosyltransferase 2 or FucT-II)
    *   **Function:** Adds a fucose sugar to the terminal galactose (Gal) residue of **Type 1 precursor chains** (primarily in secretory tissues) and also **Type 2 chains** (relevant for H on RBCs via *FUT1*)
    *   **Alleles**
        *   ***Se***: Functional allele, produces the enzyme active in secretory tissues
        *   ***se***: Amorph allele, results in no active enzyme in secretory tissues. *se* is recessive to *Se*

## **Biochemistry: Building the Lewis Antigens (on Type 1 Chains)** {-}

Lewis antigens are built on **Type 1 precursor chains** (Galβ1->3GlcNAc-R), which are primarily found in secretions and plasma as glycolipids or glycoproteins

*   **Step 1: Formation of Le<sup>a</sup> Antigen**
    *   If an individual has at least one functional ***Le*:** **gene (*FUT3*)**, the α-1,4-L-fucosyltransferase adds a fucose to the GlcNAc of the Type 1 chain
    *   **Result:** Le<sup>a</sup> antigen is formed
    *   **Structure:** Galβ1->3[**Fucα1->4**]GlcNAc-R
    *   *Requires only the Le enzyme.*

*   **Step 2: Formation of H Antigen (Type 1)**
    *   If an individual has at least one functional ***Se*:** **gene (*FUT2*)**, the α-1,2-L-fucosyltransferase adds a fucose to the terminal Galactose of the Type 1 chain (in secretory tissue)
    *   **Result:** H antigen (Type 1) is formed
    *   **Structure:** **Fucα1->2**Galβ1->3GlcNAc-R
    *   *Requires only the Se enzyme.*

*   **Step 3: Formation of Le<sup>b</sup> Antigen - The Interaction!**
    *   If an individual has *both* a functional ***Le*:** **gene** AND a functional ***Se*** **gene**, both enzymes are present
    *   The *Se* gene enzyme adds fucose to the Galactose (creating H Type 1)
    *   The *Le* gene enzyme adds fucose to the GlcNAc of the *same* chain
    *   **Result:** Le<sup>b</sup> antigen is formed, containing **two fucose** molecules on adjacent sugars
    *   **Structure:** **Fucα1->2**Galβ1->3[**Fucα1->4**]GlcNAc-R
    *   *Requires BOTH the Le and Se enzymes acting on the same Type 1 chain.*
    *   **Competition:** The *Se* gene enzyme (FucT-II) acts preferentially on the Type 1 chain. Once H is formed, the *Le* enzyme (FucT-III) readily adds the second fucose to create Le<sup>b</sup>. This efficient process means that in individuals with both *Le* and *Se* genes, most precursor chains are converted to Le<sup>b</sup>, leaving very little Le<sup>a</sup> available

## **Lewis Antigens on Red Blood Cells: Adsorption** {-}

*   Lewis antigens are synthesized primarily by epithelial cells of mucous tissues and are present as **glycolipids:** in plasma
*   These plasma Lewis glycolipids **passively adsorb:** onto the red blood cell membrane, intercalating into the lipid bilayer
*   The amount and type of Lewis antigen on the RBCs directly reflect what is present in the individual's plasma
*   Because they are adsorbed, Lewis antigen expression can decrease during pregnancy or certain diseases, and donor Lewis antigens can elute off transfused red cells over time

## **Common Lewis Phenotypes** {-}

The RBC phenotype depends on the interaction of the *Le* and *Se* genes:

*  **Le(a+b-)**
    *   **Genotype:** *Le/* (*LeLe* or *Lele*), ***sese***
    *   **Enzymes:** Has functional Le enzyme, lacks functional Se enzyme
    *   **Antigens Formed:** Can only make Le<sup>a</sup> antigen (adds fucose to GlcNAc). Cannot make H Type 1 or Le<sup>b</sup> in secretions/plasma
    *   **Result:** Le<sup>a</sup> is present in plasma/saliva and adsorbs onto RBCs

*  **Le(a-b+)**
    *   **Genotype:** *Le/* (*LeLe* or *Lele*), ***Se/*** (*SeSe* or *Sese*)
    *   **Enzymes:** Has *both* functional Le and Se enzymes
    *   **Antigens Formed:** Both enzymes act on Type 1 chains. Le<sup>b</sup> is formed efficiently. Very little free Le<sup>a</sup> remains. H Type 1 is also formed
    *   **Result:** Le<sup>b</sup> is the predominant antigen in plasma/saliva and adsorbs onto RBCs. The RBCs type as Le(a-b+). (This is the most common phenotype in many populations)

*  **Le(a-b-)**
    *   **Genotype Possibility 1:** ***lele***, *any Se* (*SeSe, Sese,* or *sese*)
        *   **Enzymes:** Lacks functional Le enzyme. Cannot add fucose to GlcNAc
        *   **Antigens Formed:** Cannot make Le<sup>a</sup> or Le<sup>b</sup>. May make H Type 1 if *Se* is present, but no Lewis antigens
        *   **Result:** No Lewis antigens in plasma/saliva to adsorb onto RBCs
    *   **Genotype Possibility 2:** *Le/*, *sese* OR *Le/*, *Se/* (Transiently)
        *   **Explanation:** Newborns may initially type Le(a-b-) as Lewis glycolipid synthesis and adsorption take time. Pregnant women often show a temporary decrease or loss of Lewis antigens on their RBCs, typing as Le(a-b-)

*  **Le(a+b+)**
    *   **Occurrence:** Very rare in adults, more common in infants/young children
    *   **Explanation:** May represent a transitional stage where both Le<sup>a</sup> and Le<sup>b</sup> glycolipids are present in plasma and adsorb. Possibly due to less efficient conversion to Le<sup>b</sup> initially or variations in enzyme activity. In adults, it's extremely uncommon because the conversion to Le<sup>b</sup> is usually very efficient in Le/Se individuals

## **Lewis Antibodies (Anti-Le<sup>a</sup>, Anti-Le<sup>b</sup>)** {-}

*   **Formation:** Often "naturally occurring," meaning they appear without known red cell stimulus (transfusion or pregnancy). Usually found in individuals with the Le(a-b-) phenotype. Le(a+b-) individuals do *not* make anti-Le<sup>b</sup>
*   **Immunoglobulin Class:** Primarily **IgM**
*   **Reactivity:** Typically react best at room temperature or below in saline (immediate spin). May sometimes be detected at 37°C and/or the AHG phase, especially with enzyme-treated cells
*   **Clinical Significance**
    *   Generally considered **clinically insignificant:** if they react *only* below 37°C. They usually do not cause hemolytic transfusion reactions (HTRs) or Hemolytic Disease of the Fetus and Newborn (HDFN)
    *   **Why usually not significant?**
        1.  Often IgM, which doesn't cross the placenta (No HDFN)
        2.  Antigens are poorly developed on fetal/newborn RBCs (No HDFN)
        3.  Antibodies are often neutralized by soluble Lewis antigens present in the donor plasma transfused with the RBCs
        4.  Lewis antigens can elute off transfused Le+ cells in an Le- recipient
        5.  Optimal reactivity is usually below body temperature
    *   **Exception:** RARELY, a Lewis antibody (especially anti-Le<sup>a</sup>) may show reactivity at 37°C and cause complement activation, potentially leading to hemolysis *in vitro* or, very infrequently, *in vivo*. Antibodies reacting at 37°C/AHG phase require more careful consideration and provision of antigen-negative units
*   **Neutralization:** Lewis antibodies can often be neutralized by incubating the patient's plasma with commercial Lewis substance or sometimes even pooled plasma/saliva (which contain soluble Lewis antigens), preventing reactivity with test cells. This can be a useful identification technique

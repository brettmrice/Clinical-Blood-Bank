# Ii {-}

The **Ii blood group system (ISBT 027)** is unique as its antigens, **i** and **I**, represent different structural arrangements – **linear versus branched** – of the same repeating **N-acetyllactosamine carbohydrate chains**. This system is characterized by a significant **developmental shift**, with fetal/newborn red cells expressing predominantly linear i antigen, which transitions to the branched I antigen on adult red cells due to the increasing activity of a specific branching enzyme. These I/i structures also serve as the crucial carbohydrate backbone for the synthesis of other important blood group antigens like ABO and H

## **The Building Blocks: Linear vs. Branched Chains** {-}

Unlike systems defined by single amino acid changes (like MNS, Rh C/c) or single sugar additions (like ABO), the I and i antigens represent different arrangements of the *same* basic repeating sugar unit: **N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc)**, which is Galactose linked to N-acetylglucosamine (Galβ1→4GlcNAc)

*   **i Antigen:** Characterized by **LINEAR**, repeating chains of N-acetyllactosamine units (Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→3Galβ1→4GlcNAc...)
    *   Think of it like a simple, straight chain of beads
    *   This linear structure is the predominant form found on **fetal and newborn red blood cells**

*   **I Antigen:** Characterized by **BRANCHED** N-acetyllactosamine chains
    *   The branching occurs when an additional N-acetyllactosamine unit is added via a **β1→6 linkage** to an internal galactose residue within the linear chain
    *   Imagine branches coming off the main trunk of the chain
    *   This branched structure becomes the predominant form on **adult red blood cells**

## **The Biochemistry: The Branching Enzyme** {-}

The transition from the linear 'i' structure to the branched 'I' structure is controlled by a specific enzyme:

*   **Enzyme:** β-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (I-branching enzyme)
*   **Gene:** *GCNT2*
*   **Action:** This enzyme creates the crucial β1→6 linkage that adds the "branch" onto the linear i-active chains
*   **Developmental Control:** The activity of this enzyme is very low in fetuses and newborns but increases significantly during the first 18-24 months of life. This enzymatic change drives the conversion of i antigen to I antigen on the red cell surface

## **Developmental Expression: The Big Switch** {-}

This change in antigen expression from birth to adulthood is a hallmark of the Ii system:

*   **Newborn RBCs:** Rich in **i antigen** (linear chains), poor in I antigen (few branched chains). Cord blood cells are an excellent source of i+ cells for testing
*   **Adult RBCs:** Rich in **I antigen** (branched chains), with only small amounts of residual i antigen
*   **Transition Period:** Takes place gradually over the first ~2 years of life as the branching enzyme activity ramps up

## **Foundation for Other Blood Groups** {-}

Crucially, the I and i carbohydrate structures are not just antigens in their own right; they form the **backbone** upon which other important carbohydrate blood group antigens are built:

*   **ABO Antigens:** The H antigen (precursor to A and B) is formed by adding fucose to the terminal galactose of these I/i chains (specifically Type 2 chains on RBCs). The A and B transferases then add their specific sugars onto the H structure
*   **Lewis Antigens:** Lewis antigens are built on Type 1 chains, which also have underlying i/I structures, primarily in secretions and plasma

So, the complexity of the I/i branching pattern underlies the structure where ABO/H antigens are added

## **Location of Ii Antigens** {-}

Ii antigens are widely distributed:

*   **Red Blood Cells:** As integral parts of glycoproteins and glycolipids
*   **Other Cells:** Leukocytes, platelets
*   **Body Fluids:** Present on soluble glycoproteins in plasma, saliva, milk, amniotic fluid, etc

## **Ii System Antibodies** {-}

Antibodies in this system are relatively common, particularly autoantibodies

*   **Anti-I**
    *   **Type:** Often a naturally occurring **autoantibody**, usually **IgM**
    *   **Reactivity:** Typically a **cold agglutinin**, reacting best at 4°C. Agglutination weakens or disappears as the temperature increases towards 37°C. Reactivity is often enhanced by enzyme treatment of test cells
    *   **Clinical Significance**
        *   **Benign Autoanti-I:** Very common. Can interfere with *in vitro* testing at room temperature (e.g., ABO reverse grouping, immediate spin crossmatch, antibody screening) but is usually harmless *in vivo* because it doesn't react at body temperature. Prewarming techniques are used to bypass its interference
        *   **Pathologic Autoanti-I:** Less common, but significant. These antibodies have a **high thermal amplitude** (reactivity extends to 30°C or higher) and/or high titer. They can cause **Cold Agglutinin Syndrome (CAS)**, a type of autoimmune hemolytic anemia where the antibody binds in cooler extremities and activates complement, leading to hemolysis upon warming in the central circulation
    *   **Association:** Potent, transient autoanti-I production is strongly associated with infections by ***Mycoplasma pneumoniae***
    *   **Alloanti-I:** Very rare, found only in individuals with the "adult i" phenotype (see below)

*   **Anti-i**
    *   **Type:** Usually an **autoantibody**, typically **IgM**, cold-reacting
    *   **Reactivity:** Reacts preferentially with cord blood cells (rich in i) and weakly or not at all with adult cells (rich in I)
    *   **Clinical Significance:** Mostly benign, but potent examples with high thermal amplitude can occasionally cause hemolysis
    *   **Association:** Strongly associated with **Infectious Mononucleosis (IM)** caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Also seen in some lymphoproliferative disorders
    *   **Alloanti-i:** Extremely rare

## **The Adult i Phenotype** {-}

*   A rare phenotype where individuals **fail to develop** strong I antigen expression into adulthood. Their red cells remain rich in i antigen, similar to newborn cells (i+I-)
*   **Cause:** Usually due to inheriting two non-functional alleles of the *GCNT2* gene (encoding the branching enzyme)
*   **Antibodies:** These individuals are capable of forming clinically significant **alloanti-I** if transfused with normal adult (I+) red blood cells. Finding compatible blood (other adult i donors) is difficult

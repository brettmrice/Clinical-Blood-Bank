# Biologic Properties {-}

We've talked about *how* the complement system gets activated (the pathways), but now let's focus on *what it actually does* once those protein dominos start falling. These actions are the reason complement is so critical in both protecting us and, unfortunately, sometimes causing problems in transfusion medicine!

Think of the activated complement components as having several distinct "job functions" in the body:

## **Cell Lysis: The "Punching Holes" Function (via MAC)** {-}

*   **Key Player:** The **Membrane Attack Complex (MAC)**, specifically **C5b-9**
*   **What it Does:** This is the most dramatic outcome. The fully assembled MAC inserts itself into the target cell's membrane (like a red blood cell, bacterium, or even some virus-infected cells), forming a transmembrane channel or pore
*   **Biological Consequence:** This pore disrupts the cell's osmotic integrity. Water and ions flood into the cell, causing it to swell and burst (lyse). For red blood cells, this is **intravascular hemolysis** – destruction *within* the blood vessels, releasing free hemoglobin into the plasma
*   **Blood Bank Relevance**
    *   **Acute Hemolytic Transfusion Reactions (AHTRs):** Especially in ABO incompatibility where potent IgM antibodies rapidly activate complement to completion, leading to massive intravascular hemolysis. This is a medical emergency!
    *   **Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH):** Patients' red cells lack complement regulatory proteins (CD55, CD59), making them highly susceptible to spontaneous complement-mediated lysis
    *   **Visible Hemolysis in Testing:** Seeing hemolysis in a test tube (e.g., during crossmatching or antibody ID) is often a sign of complement activation to the terminal pathway and is considered a positive reaction indicating potential *in vivo* hemolysis

## **Opsonization: The "Eat Me" Signal** {-}

*   **Key Player:** Primarily **C3b** (and its breakdown product **iC3b**). C4b plays a minor role
*   **What it Does:** When C3 is cleaved, C3b fragments covalently bind ("stick") to the surface of the target particle (e.g., a red cell coated with antibody, or a bacterium). This coating process is called **opsonization**
*   **Biological Consequence:** Phagocytic cells, particularly **macrophages** (found abundantly in the spleen and liver) and neutrophils, have specific **complement receptors** (like **CR1** which binds C3b, and CR3/CR4 which bind iC3b). When these receptors encounter a C3b-coated particle, it triggers phagocytosis – the engulfment and destruction of the particle
*   **Blood Bank Relevance**
    *   **Extravascular Hemolysis:** This is the primary mechanism for removing red cells coated with complement (often triggered by IgG antibodies that activate complement only partially, or when MAC formation is inhibited). Macrophages in the spleen and liver recognize the C3b-coated cells and remove them from circulation. This is typically slower and less dramatic than intravascular hemolysis but is a common cause of **Delayed Hemolytic Transfusion Reactions (DHTRs)** and is seen in **Warm Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia (WAIHA)**
    *   **DAT Positivity:** The stable breakdown product **C3d** often remains on the red cell surface after C3b has been cleaved further by regulatory factors. The presence of C3d is detected by **anti-C3d** in the AHG reagent during a **Direct Antiglobulin Test (DAT)**, indicating complement activation occurred *in vivo*

## **Inflammation: Sounding the Alarm** {-}

*   **Key Players:** The small fragments released during cleavage: **C5a, C3a,** and **C4a**. These are collectively called **anaphylatoxins**
*   **What they Do:** These peptides diffuse away from the site of activation and interact with receptors on various cells, particularly **mast cells** and **basophils**
*   **Biological Consequences**
    *   **Mast Cell Degranulation:** Causes release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators. This leads to increased **vascular permeability** (leaky blood vessels -> swelling/edema) and **vasodilation** (widening of blood vessels -> redness, drop in blood pressure)
    *   **Smooth Muscle Contraction:** Can affect airways and blood vessels
    *   **Chemotaxis:** **C5a** is a powerful chemoattractant, meaning it recruits inflammatory cells like **neutrophils** and **macrophages** to the site of complement activation, amplifying the inflammatory response
*   **Blood Bank Relevance**
    *   **Symptoms of Transfusion Reactions:** Many systemic symptoms associated with hemolytic transfusion reactions (fever, chills, flushing, hypotension, back pain, shortness of breath) are mediated by the release of these anaphylatoxins and subsequent inflammatory responses
    *   C5a-mediated neutrophil activation is also implicated in the pathophysiology of Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI), although the primary trigger there involves antibodies against HLA or neutrophil antigens

## **Immune Complex Clearance: Housekeeping Duty** {-}

*   **Key Players:** **C3b** and Red Blood Cell **CR1** receptors
*   **What it Does:** Antibodies binding to soluble antigens form circulating **immune complexes**. Complement activation (specifically C3b deposition) coats these complexes. Red blood cells have CR1 receptors that bind these C3b-coated complexes
*   **Biological Consequence:** Red blood cells act like a transport system, shuttling these potentially harmful immune complexes from the circulation to the liver and spleen. There, resident macrophages efficiently remove the complexes from the RBC surface (usually without destroying the RBC itself) for disposal
*   **Blood Bank Relevance:** This is more of a general immune function, but it highlights the role of RBCs beyond oxygen transport. Defects in this clearance mechanism can contribute to autoimmune diseases where immune complexes deposit in tissues (like lupus)

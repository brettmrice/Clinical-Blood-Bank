# High Prevalence Antigens {-}

High-prevalence antigens, sometimes called "public" antigens, are red cell markers found on the vast majority of the population, often exceeding 99% frequency. While their presence is the norm, their significance in transfusion medicine arises dramatically when a rare individual *lacks* one of these common antigens and develops a corresponding antibody. This scenario poses a critical challenge: finding compatible (antigen-negative) blood becomes exceptionally difficult, often requiring extensive screening and coordination through rare donor networks

## **Antigens of High Prevalence: The Common Denominators** {-}

*   **Definition:** A high-prevalence antigen (sometimes called a public antigen) is a red blood cell surface antigen expressed by almost everyone in a given population (or across multiple populations)

## **Why are they important in Blood Bank?** {-}

*   **Antibodies are Rare:** Because most people *have* the antigen, they usually won't make an antibody against it (due to self-tolerance). Therefore, antibodies to high-prevalence antigens are infrequently encountered
*   **The Compatibility Crisis:** *When* someone *does* form an antibody to a high-prevalence antigen (because they are one of the rare individuals lacking it), finding compatible (antigen-negative) blood becomes extremely difficult. Imagine needing blood negative for an antigen that 99.9% of donors have!
*   **Clinical Significance:** Many antibodies against high-prevalence antigens are **clinically significant**, capable of causing Hemolytic Transfusion Reactions (HTR) and/or Hemolytic Disease of the Fetus and Newborn (HDFN)
*   **Key Biochemical Carriers:** These antigens can reside on various structures: glycoproteins (like Kell, Lutheran, Gerbich), proteins (like Band 3/Diego, Aquaporin-1/Colton), or even carbohydrate structures (like I, P)

##  **Examples of Important High-Prevalence Antigens** {-}

Note: This isn't exhaustive, but covers many clinically relevant examples

### **k (Cellano) - Kell System (KEL, ISBT 006)** {-}
*   **Biochemistry:** Kell glycoprotein
*   **Prevalence:** >99% in Caucasians, >99.9% in Black populations. Antithetical to K (Kpa)
*   **Antibody (Anti-k):** IgG, clinically significant (HTR, HDFN). Finding k-negative (K+k-) blood is difficult
*   **Antigen-Negative:** K+k- individuals. Extremely rare K<sub>0</sub> (Kell null) individuals lack all Kell antigens

### **Kp<sup>b</sup> - Kell System (KEL, ISBT 006)** {-}
*   **Biochemistry:** Kell glycoprotein
*   **Prevalence:** >99.9% in most populations. Antithetical to Kp<sup>a</sup>
*   **Antibody (Anti-Kp<sup>b</sup>):** IgG, clinically significant (HTR, HDFN). Finding Kp(b-) blood is very difficult
*   **Antigen-Negative:** Kp(a+b-) or Kp(a-b-) (K<sub>0</sub>)

### **Js<sup>b</sup> - Kell System (KEL, ISBT 006)** {-}
*   **Biochemistry:** Kell glycoprotein
*   **Prevalence:** >99.9% in Caucasians, ~80% in Black populations (Js<sup>a</sup> is more common in Black populations). Antithetical to Js<sup>a</sup>
*   **Antibody (Anti-Js<sup>b</sup>):** IgG, clinically significant (HTR, HDFN). Finding Js(b-) blood is difficult, especially for non-Black patients
*   **Antigen-Negative:** Js(a+b-)

### **Lu<sup>b</sup> - Lutheran System (LU, ISBT 005)** {-}
*   **Biochemistry:** Lutheran glycoprotein (BCAM)
*   **Prevalence:** >99% in most populations. Antithetical to Lu<sup>a</sup>
*   **Antibody (Anti-Lu<sup>b</sup>):** Usually IgG, sometimes IgM/mixed. Can cause mild-moderate HTR (often delayed) and mild HDFN
*   **Antigen-Negative:** Lu(a+b-) or rare Lu(a-b-) null phenotypes. Finding Lu(b-) blood is difficult

### **U - MNS System (MNS, ISBT 002)** {-}
*   **Biochemistry:** Associated with Glycophorin B (GPB). Present when either S or s antigen is expressed normally
*   **Prevalence:** >99.9% in Caucasians, slightly lower but still very high in Black populations (~99%)
*   **Antibody (Anti-U):** IgG, **highly clinically significant** (severe HTR, severe HDFN)
*   **Antigen-Negative:** U-negative individuals are almost exclusively of African descent and lack GPB (usually S-s- phenotype). Finding U-negative blood is extremely challenging and requires screening donors of African ancestry

### **I - I System (I, ISBT 027)** {-}
*   **Biochemistry:** Branched carbohydrate structure on precursor chains (related to ABO). 'I' develops from fetal 'i' antigen during the first ~18 months of life
*   **Prevalence:** Virtually 100% in adults. (Fetal/newborn cells are rich in i, poor in I)
*   **Antibody (Anti-I):** Usually a benign, **cold-reacting IgM autoantibody**. Can cause issues in cold temperatures (Cold Agglutinin Disease) or interfere with room temperature/immediate spin testing. Pathologic anti-I can be potent IgM hemolysins. Alloanti-I is extremely rare (seen in adult i phenotype individuals)
*   **Antigen-Negative:** Rare adult i phenotype individuals

### **Vel - Vel System (VEL, ISBT 035)** {-}
*   **Biochemistry:** Carried on protein SMIM1
*   **Prevalence:** >99.9% in most populations
*   **Antibody (Anti-Vel):** Often mixed IgG/IgM, potent complement activator. **Highly clinically significant** (severe immediate HTR). Known for being difficult to identify serologically (weak/variable reactions)
*   **Antigen-Negative:** Vel-negative phenotype is very rare (<0.01%). Finding Vel-negative blood is exceptionally difficult, relying heavily on rare donor registries

### **J MH (John Milton Hagen) - J MH System (J MH, ISBT 026)** {-}
*   **Biochemistry:** Located on Semaphorin 7A (CD108), a GPI-linked protein
*   **Prevalence:** >99.9% in most populations
*   **Antibody (Anti-J MH):** Usually IgG, often weak, refractile, and difficult to work with ("nebulous"). Generally considered **clinically insignificant** or only causing mild RBC destruction. Can mask other significant antibodies. Antigen expression can be weak or variable

### **Ge3 - Gerbich System (GE, ISBT 020)** {-}
*   **Biochemistry:** Located on Glycophorin C (GPC) and Glycophorin D (GPD)
*   **Prevalence:** >99% in most populations
*   **Antibody (Anti-Ge3):** IgG, clinically significant (HTR, HDFN)
*   **Antigen-Negative:** Individuals with Gerbich null phenotypes (e.g., Ge:-2,-3,-4 or Leach phenotype). Finding Ge3-negative blood is difficult

### **Emm - EMM System (EMM, ISBT 044)** {-}
*   **Biochemistry:** Unknown protein carrier (as of recent knowledge, may be updated)
*   **Prevalence:** >99.99% (extremely high)
*   **Antibody (Anti-Emm):** IgG, potent complement activator. **Highly clinically significant** (severe HTR, HDFN)
*   **Antigen-Negative:** Emm-negative phenotype is exceedingly rare. Finding compatible blood requires extensive international collaboration

## **Challenges and Management** {-}

*   **Identification:** Confirming the antibody specificity often requires testing against a panel of rare antigen-negative cells, typically done in an Immunohematology Reference Laboratory (IRL)
*   **Finding Compatible Blood:** This is the major hurdle. Strategies include:
    *   Screening large numbers of donors (thousands)
    *   Utilizing national and international **Rare Donor Programs**
    *   Testing family members (siblings have a 1 in 4 chance of having the same rare phenotype)
    *   **Autologous donation:** (patient donating for themselves) if the need is anticipated and the patient is eligible
    *   Molecular genotyping of donors can sometimes help identify rare antigen-negative units more efficiently
*   **Clinical Decisions:** Balancing the risk of transfusion reaction vs. the risk of delaying transfusion. Sometimes, the "least incompatible" blood might be considered in emergencies if truly antigen-negative blood is unavailable, but this carries significant risk

## **Key Terms** {-}

*   **High-Prevalence Antigen:** An antigen found on the red blood cells of a very large percentage (typically >99%) of a given population
*   **Null Phenotype:** A rare phenotype where an individual lacks all antigens within a specific blood group system (e.g., K<sub>0</sub>, Rh<sub>null</sub>, Lu(a-b-)). These individuals may produce complex antibodies reacting with all cells except those of the same null type
*   **Rare Donor Program:** A system or registry (often national or international) that catalogs donors known to have rare blood types (lacking high-prevalence antigens or possessing combinations of uncommon antigens) to facilitate finding compatible blood for patients with rare antibodies
*   **Reference Laboratory (Immunohematology Reference Laboratory - IRL):** A specialized laboratory equipped with the reagents (including rare antisera and antigen-typed cells), techniques, and expertise to investigate and resolve complex immunohematology problems, including identifying antibodies to high- and low-prevalence antigens
*   **Clinically Significant (Antibody):** An antibody capable of causing adverse reactions to transfusion (Hemolytic Transfusion Reactions - HTR) or causing Hemolytic Disease of the Fetus and Newborn (HDFN). Many antibodies to high-prevalence antigens fall into this category
*   **Antithetical Antigen:** One of a pair of antigens encoded by alleles at the same gene locus (e.g., K and k, Fy<sup>a</sup> and Fy<sup>b</sup>). If an antigen is high prevalence (like k), its antithetical partner (K) is often low prevalence

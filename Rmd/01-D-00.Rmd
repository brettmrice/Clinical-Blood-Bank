# Blood Components {-}

This section covers the components derived from whole blood or apheresis

##  **Core Components** {-}

*   **Red Blood Cells (RBCs)**
    *   **What:** Concentrated red cells (carry oxygen via hemoglobin) suspended in plasma/additive solution
    *   **Use:** Treat symptomatic anemia, acute blood loss
    *   **Key:** Stored at 1-6°C; expiry 21-42 days depending on solution
*   **Platelets**
    *   **What:** Cell fragments essential for forming blood clots (primary hemostasis). Collected via apheresis (SDP) or from whole blood (WBD, requires pooling)
    *   **Use:** Prevent/treat bleeding due to low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) or dysfunction
    *   **Key:** Stored at 20-24°C *with agitation*; short expiry (5-7 days) due to bacterial risk
*   **Plasma**
    *   **What:** Liquid portion of blood containing water, proteins, and coagulation factors. Prepared as FFP (frozen <8hrs), PF24 (frozen <24hrs), etc
    *   **Use:** Replace multiple coagulation factors (e.g., liver disease, DIC, massive transfusion, warfarin reversal)
    *   **Key:** Stored frozen (≤ -18°C) for 1 year; must be ABO compatible
*   **Cryoprecipitated AHF (Cryo)**
    *   **What:** Concentrate precipitated from thawed FFP, rich in Fibrinogen, Factor VIII, vWF, Factor XIII
    *   **Use:** Primarily to replace fibrinogen; secondary for Factors VIII, XIII, vWD if concentrates unavailable
    *   **Key:** Stored frozen (≤ -18°C); thawed units stored at room temp, expire in 4-6 hours. Requires pooling for adult dose
*   **Granulocytes**
    *   **What:** Concentrate of neutrophils collected by apheresis (donor requires stimulation)
    *   **Use:** Rare indication for severe neutropenia with documented infection unresponsive to antimicrobials
    *   **Key:** Stored at 20-24°C *without agitation*; 24-hr expiry; MUST be irradiated and crossmatched. High reaction rate
*   **Whole Blood**
    *   **What:** Unseparated blood containing RBCs, plasma, platelets, WBCs
    *   **Use:** Largely replaced by component therapy; niche use in massive hemorrhage (trauma/military) or resource-limited settings
    *   **Key:** Stored at 1-6°C; platelets/labile factors degrade quickly. Requires ABO identical transfusion

##  **Modifications & Specialized Components** {-}

*   **Leukocyte-Reduced Components**
    *   **What:** RBCs or Platelets processed (usually by filtration) to remove most WBCs
    *   **Purpose:** Reduce febrile reactions (FNHTRs), HLA alloimmunization, and CMV transmission. Standard practice in many regions (Universal Leukoreduction)
    *   **Key:** Does not change expiry if done via closed system
*   **Irradiated Components**
    *   **What:** Cellular components (RBCs, Platelets, Granulocytes) exposed to radiation
    *   **Purpose:** Inactivate donor T-lymphocytes to prevent Transfusion-Associated Graft-vs-Host Disease (TA-GVHD) in at-risk recipients
    *   **Key:** Mandatory for granulocytes, directed donations from relatives, immunocompromised pts. Shortens RBC expiry (original OR 28 days post-irradiation, whichever is first); does not change platelet expiry
*   **Washed Red Blood Cells / Platelets**
    *   **What:** Cellular components washed with saline to remove plasma proteins
    *   **Purpose:** Prevent severe allergic reactions (esp. in IgA deficiency w/ anti-IgA); reduce supernatant potassium in RBCs for neonates/renal patients
    *   **Key:** Open system process shortens expiry to 24 hrs (RBCs) or 4 hrs (Platelets)
*   **Frozen/Deglycerolized Red Blood Cells**
    *   **What:** RBCs treated with glycerol (cryoprotectant), frozen (≤ -65°C) for long-term storage (10 yrs), then thawed and washed (deglycerolized) before use
    *   **Purpose:** Store rare units, autologous units, strategic reserves
    *   **Key:** Deglycerolization (washing) is required to prevent hemolysis; post-wash expiry is 24 hrs (open system) or longer (closed system)
*   **Rejuvenated Red Blood Cells**
    *   **What:** Stored RBCs treated *in vitro* with solutions (PIPA) to restore ATP and 2,3-DPG levels
    *   **Purpose:** Salvage near-expiry units; potentially improve O₂ delivery (debated); enhance quality for freezing
    *   **Key:** Requires extensive washing after rejuvenation; 24-hr post-wash expiry (open system). Not routine
*   **Apheresis Products**
    *   **What:** Components collected using an apheresis machine (Platelets, Plasma, Double RBCs, Granulocytes, Stem Cells)
    *   **Purpose:** Obtain larger dose of specific component from single donor, reducing recipient exposure
    *   **Key:** Donor may experience citrate reaction. Enables more frequent donation of certain components (e.g., platelets)
*   **Hematopoietic Progenitors (HPCs / Stem Cells)**
    *   **What:** Stem cells capable of generating all blood cells; collected from bone marrow (HPC-M), peripheral blood after mobilization (PBSC / HPC-A), or umbilical cord blood (HPC-C)
    *   **Purpose:** Used for transplantation to restore hematopoietic function after high-dose chemo/radiation or in marrow failure states
    *   **Key:** Requires HLA matching for allogeneic transplant; often cryopreserved using DMSO; specialized processing and infusion protocols apply
*   **Fractionation Products**
    *   **What:** Highly purified plasma proteins derived from large pools of plasma via industrial manufacturing (e.g., Albumin, IVIG, Factor VIII/IX concentrates, PCCs, Fibrinogen concentrate)
    *   **Purpose:** Provide specific protein replacement therapy with enhanced viral safety and standardized dosing
    *   **Key:** Regulated as pharmaceuticals, often stored at room temp/refrigerated with long shelf lives. Distinct from blood bank components

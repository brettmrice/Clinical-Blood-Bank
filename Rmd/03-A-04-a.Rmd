# Pathway Mechanisms {-}

The complement system is a fascinating and powerful part of our immune system – think of it as a cascade of protein dominos that, once tipped over, leads to some major downstream effects like inflammation, marking targets for destruction, and even directly blowing holes in cells! It's part of the **innate** immune system but forms a crucial bridge to the **adaptive** system (especially via antibodies)

In blood banking, complement activation is super important because it's a major way that incompatible red blood cells get destroyed, either inside the blood vessels (**intravascular hemolysis**) or by being flagged for removal by macrophages (**extravascular hemolysis**). Understanding *how* it gets activated helps us understand transfusion reactions and interpret our tests (like the DAT!)

There are three main pathways to activate complement, but we'll focus on the two most relevant for us: the **Classical** and **Alternative** pathways. They start differently but eventually merge to create the same powerful effector molecules

## **The Classical Pathway: Antibody-Driven Activation** {-}

*   **The Trigger:** This pathway is typically initiated when antibodies bind to antigens, forming **immune complexes**. In blood banking, this usually means:
    *   **IgM:** Just ONE IgM molecule bound to a red cell antigen is enough to kick things off! IgM is a pentamer, and its structure is perfect for binding the first complement protein, C1q. This is why ABO mismatches (involving IgM anti-A/anti-B) can cause such rapid and severe complement activation
    *   **IgG:** It's less efficient. You generally need *two* IgG molecules bound close together on the cell surface to effectively bind C1q. Not all IgG subclasses are equal: **IgG3** is the best activator, followed by **IgG1**. IgG2 is very poor, and IgG4 does *not* activate the classical pathway. This is relevant for antibodies like anti-K (often IgG1) or anti-Jk<sup>a</sup> (can be IgG3)
    *   (Less common triggers include C-reactive protein binding to microbes)
*   **The Mechanism (The Dominoes Falling)**
    1.  **Initiation (C1 Complex)** The process starts with the **C1 complex**, which consists of C1q (the recognition unit) and two molecules each of C1r and C1s (serine proteases - enzymes that cut other proteins)
        *   **C1q binds:** to the Fc region (the "stem" of the Y) of the bound IgM or adjacent IgG antibodies
        *   This binding causes a shape change in C1q, which activates **C1r**
        *   Activated C1r then cleaves and activates **C1s**. Now C1s is an active enzyme
    2.  **Activating C4 and C2**
        *   Activated C1s finds and cleaves **C4** into two pieces: **C4a** (a small fragment that floats away, acting as a weak anaphylatoxin - promoting inflammation) and **C4b** (a larger fragment)
        *   **C4b:** is chemically unstable and quickly tries to form a covalent bond with the nearby cell surface (e.g., the red blood cell membrane). If it doesn't bind quickly, it gets inactivated
        *   Activated C1s also cleaves **C2** into **C2a** and **C2b**. (Note: convention has changed; C2a is now considered the larger enzymatic fragment)
        *   **C2a:** binds to the surface-bound **C4b**
    3.  **Formation of the C3 Convertase**
        *   The complex formed by **C4b2a** is the **Classical Pathway C3 Convertase**. Its job is to chop up lots of C3 molecules. This is a major amplification point!
    4.  **Activating C3 (The Central Step)**
        *   The C4b2a enzyme cleaves **C3** into **C3a** (another anaphylatoxin, more potent than C4a, causing inflammation and attracting phagocytes) and **C3b** (the larger fragment)
        *   **C3b:** is crucial! Like C4b, it tries to bind covalently to nearby surfaces. It acts as a powerful **opsonin**, meaning it coats the cell and flags it for destruction by phagocytes (like macrophages in the spleen/liver) that have C3b receptors. This leads to **extravascular hemolysis**
        *   C3b also participates in forming the *next* enzyme complex
    5.  **Formation of the C5 Convertase**
        *   Some of the newly generated **C3b** binds to the existing C4b2a complex, forming **C4b2a3b**. This is the **Classical Pathway C5 Convertase**
    6.  **Activating C5**
        *   The C4b2a3b enzyme cleaves **C5** into **C5a** (a very potent anaphylatoxin and chemotactic factor, strongly recruiting inflammatory cells) and **C5b** (the larger fragment)
        *   **C5b:** is the initiating factor for the final stage – the Membrane Attack Complex (MAC)

## **The Alternative Pathway: Spontaneous Activation & Amplification** {-}

*   **The Trigger:** This pathway doesn't rely on antibodies for initiation. It's triggered by:
    *   **Spontaneous "Tick-over":** C3 molecules in the plasma are inherently slightly unstable and can spontaneously hydrolyze (react with water) at a low rate, forming **C3(H2O)**. This happens continuously
    *   **Foreign Surfaces:** Certain microbial surfaces (like bacterial LPS or yeast cell walls) or other activating surfaces lack the regulatory proteins that normally protect our own cells
    *   (IgA immune complexes can sometimes activate this pathway too)
*   **The Mechanism**
    1.  **Initiation (Tick-over)**
        *   **C3(H2O):** forms in the plasma
        *   This altered C3 can bind a plasma protein called **Factor B**
        *   Another plasma protease, **Factor D**, which is always active but at low concentration, cleaves the bound Factor B into **Ba** (released) and **Bb**
        *   This forms the complex **C3(H2O)Bb**, which is a fluid-phase **C3 convertase**. It's not very stable, but it can cleave a few C3 molecules into C3a and C3b
    2.  **Deposition and Amplification on Surfaces**
        *   The **C3b** generated by the tick-over (or by the classical pathway!) can covalently attach to nearby surfaces – including host cells *and* foreign particles (like bacteria or potentially even red cells under certain conditions)
        *   **Crucial Difference:** Our own cells have regulatory proteins (like Factor H) that quickly bind deposited C3b and allow **Factor I** to cleave and inactivate it (preventing damage to self). Foreign surfaces often *lack* these regulators
        *   On an **activating surface** (lacking regulators), the bound **C3b** can bind **Factor B**
        *   **Factor D:** again cleaves Factor B into Ba and Bb
        *   This forms **C3bBb**, the surface-bound **Alternative Pathway C3 Convertase**
    3.  **Stabilization and Amplification**
        *   The C3bBb convertase is inherently unstable, but it can be stabilized by another protein called **Properdin (Factor P)**. Properdin binding extends the half-life of the convertase, allowing it to cleave *many more* C3 molecules
        *   This creates a powerful **amplification loop** each C3bBb complex generates more C3b, which can then form more C3bBb complexes on the activating surface
    4.  **Formation of the C5 Convertase**
        *   When an additional **C3b** molecule binds to the C3bBb complex, it forms **C3bBb3b**. This is the **Alternative Pathway C5 Convertase**
    5.  **Activating C5**
        *   Just like the classical pathway C5 convertase, C3bBb3b cleaves **C5** into **C5a** (inflammation/chemotaxis) and **C5b** (initiates MAC)

## **Convergence and The Terminal Pathway: Membrane Attack Complex (MAC)** {-}

*   **Convergence:** Both the Classical (C4b2a3b) and Alternative (C3bBb3b) pathways generate a **C5 convertase**. From this point on, the steps are the same
*   **Mechanism**
    1.  **Initiation** **C5b** is generated and binds transiently to the target cell surface near the C5 convertase
    2.  **Assembly**
        *   C5b sequentially binds **C6**, then **C7**. The **C5b-7** complex undergoes a conformational change and inserts itself into the lipid bilayer of the target cell membrane
        *   **C8:** then binds to the C5b-7 complex and also inserts into the membrane, creating a small pore
        *   **C9:** molecules (10-16 of them!) are recruited to the site. They bind to the C5b-8 complex and polymerize, inserting through the membrane to form a large, ring-like channel
    3.  **Lysis** This complete structure, **C5b-9**, is the **Membrane Attack Complex (MAC)**. It forms a stable pore through the cell membrane, disrupting the osmotic balance. Water and ions rush in, causing the cell to swell and burst (**lysis**)
*   **Blood Bank Relevance:** MAC formation on red blood cells causes **intravascular hemolysis**, the rapid destruction of RBCs within the blood vessels. This is characteristic of severe, acute hemolytic transfusion reactions (like ABO incompatibility)

## **Regulation is Key!** {-}

It's crucial that complement activation is tightly controlled to prevent it from damaging our own healthy tissues. Numerous regulatory proteins exist in plasma and on our cell surfaces (e.g., C1 Inhibitor, Factor H, Factor I, DAF/CD55, Protectin/CD59) that limit the cascade at various steps. Lack of these regulators on foreign surfaces allows complement to target them effectively

## **Blood Bank Summary Points** {-}

*   **Classical Pathway:** Triggered mainly by **IgM** and **IgG** (subclasses matter!) binding to RBC antigens. Key in HTRs, HDFN, AIHA
*   **Alternative Pathway:** Activated by surfaces lacking regulators; acts as a major **amplification loop** for C3b deposited by *either* pathway
*   **C3b Deposition:** Leads to **opsonization** and **extravascular hemolysis** (removal by macrophages)
*   **C3d:** A stable breakdown product of C3b that remains on the RBC surface. Detected by **anti-C3d** in AHG reagent (DAT/IAT)
*   **MAC Formation (C5b-9):** Leads to **intravascular hemolysis**. Visible hemolysis in test tubes is a sign of complement activation to completion
*   **Anaphylatoxins (C3a, C4a, C5a):** Contribute to inflammatory symptoms sometimes seen in transfusion reactions

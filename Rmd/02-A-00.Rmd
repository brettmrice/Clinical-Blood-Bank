# (PART\*) Blood Group Systems {-}

# Genetics {-}

Basic genetics tells us *what* we inherit (alleles) and the rules of expression (dominance/codominance). Molecular genetics explains *how* tiny differences in DNA create those different alleles and antigens. Inheritance patterns describe *how* these alleles are transmitted through generations, often influenced by whether the genes are linked together on chromosomes. Together, these principles form the foundation for understanding blood group diversity and its critical implications in transfusion medicine

Think of blood group genetics like building with LEGOs® following specific instructions:

##  **The Instructions (Basic Genetics)** {-}
*   Our traits, like blood type, are determined by **genes**, specific sections of our DNA blueprint found at particular addresses called **loci:** on our chromosomes
*   Genes come in different versions called **alleles:** (e.g., *A, B, O* alleles for the ABO gene). We inherit *one* allele from each parent
*   Our specific inherited pair of alleles is our **genotype:** (e.g., *AO*). What we actually detect on the red cells in the lab is the **phenotype** (e.g., Group A)
*   Alleles can interact: **Codominant:** ones (like *A* and *B*) both show up if inherited together (AB phenotype). A **dominant** allele (like *D* in Rh) shows up even if paired with a **recessive** one (*d*), which only shows its trait if two copies are present (*dd*)

##  **Decoding the Instructions (Molecular Genetics)** {-}
*   The difference between alleles lies in their specific DNA **sequence:** (the order of A, T, C, G bases)
*   Variations like **Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs):** – a change in just one DNA base – are very common. Other variations include **insertions/deletions (indels)**
*   These DNA changes can alter the **protein:** the gene codes for. This protein might *be* the antigen (like Rh or Kell proteins) or it might be an **enzyme** (like the ABO glycosyltransferases) that builds a carbohydrate antigen
*   *Example:* A few specific SNPs differentiate the *A* and *B* alleles, changing the enzyme they produce, which in turn adds a different sugar to make the A or B antigen. A deletion causing a **frameshift:** often leads to a non-functional enzyme, resulting in the *O* allele
*   Molecular techniques (like PCR-based methods) allow us to directly read the DNA sequence (genotyping) to predict the phenotype, which is invaluable for complex cases, recently transfused patients, or fetal testing

##  **Passing Down the Instructions (Inheritance)** {-}
*   We inherit alleles according to **Mendel's Laws**:
    *   **Segregation:** Each parent passes only *one* of their two alleles for a gene to their offspring
    *   **Independent Assortment:** Genes for different traits on *different* chromosomes are inherited independently (e.g., ABO type doesn't influence Rh type)
*   **Exception - Linkage:** Genes located *close together* on the same chromosome (like *RHD* and *RHCE*, or *GYPA* and *GYPB* for MNS) are often inherited as a block, called a **haplotype** (e.g., *DCe*, *Ns*)
*   **Punnett squares:** help predict the probability of offspring inheriting specific genotypes and phenotypes based on parental genotypes
*   Understanding inheritance helps explain family patterns, predict risk for Hemolytic Disease of the Fetus and Newborn (HDFN), and understand why certain antibodies might be formed

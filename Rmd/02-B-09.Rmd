# Duffy {-}

The **Duffy blood group system (ISBT 008)** is clinically significant due to its role in transfusion reactions and HDFN, but it holds unique biological interest because its primary antigens, **Fy<sup>a</sup> and Fy<sup>b</sup>**, reside on a protein that acts as a **receptor for chemokines** and, crucially, is used by the **_Plasmodium vivax_ malaria parasite** to invade red blood cells. The antigens are defined by amino acid variations on the **Duffy Antigen Receptor for Chemokines (DARC)** protein, encoded by the *DARC* gene. The common Fy(a-b-) phenotype, prevalent in individuals of African descent, provides strong resistance to *P. vivax* malaria and has a distinct molecular basis compared to other blood group null phenotypes

## **Genetics: The *DARC* Gene** {-}

*   The Duffy antigens are encoded by the ***DARC* gene** (also historically known as *FY*), located on **chromosome 1**
*   The main alleles determining the Fy<sup>a</sup> and Fy<sup>b</sup> antigens are *FY\*A* and *FY\*B*

## **Biochemistry: The DARC Protein** {-}

*   **Structure:** The *DARC* gene codes for the **Duffy Antigen Receptor for Chemokines (DARC)** protein. This is a **glycosylated, multi-pass transmembrane protein** (passing through the RBC membrane 7 times), typical of many cell surface receptors
*   **Function:** DARC has two well-established functions:
    1.  **Chemokine Receptor** It binds a wide variety of pro-inflammatory chemokines (small signaling proteins involved in inflammation and immune responses), particularly those of the CC and CXC families. It's considered a "silent" or "scavenging" receptor, potentially regulating inflammation by binding excess chemokines without initiating traditional signaling cascades. It's expressed not only on RBCs but also on endothelial cells lining blood vessels (especially post-capillary venules), Purkinje cells in the cerebellum, and other tissues
    2.  **Malaria Receptor** It serves as the essential receptor for the merozoite stage of the malaria parasite ***Plasmodium vivax*** (and the related monkey malaria parasite *P. knowlesi*) to enter red blood cells

## **The Major Duffy Antigens: Fy<sup>a</sup> and Fy<sup>b</sup>** {-}

These are the two main, antithetical antigens of the system:

*   **Biochemical Difference:** The difference between Fy<sup>a</sup> and Fy<sup>b</sup> arises from a **single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)** in exon 2 of the *DARC* gene. This SNP results in a single **amino acid substitution** at position 42 on the first extracellular loop of the DARC protein:
    *   **Fy<sup>a</sup> (FY1):** Has **Glycine (Gly)** at position 42
    *   **Fy<sup>b</sup> (FY2):** Has **Aspartic Acid (Asp)** at position 42
*   **Inheritance:** An individual inherits one *DARC* allele from each parent, leading to three common genotypes:
    *   *FY\*A/FY\*A* → Phenotype: Fy(a+b-)
    *   *FY\*B/FY\*B* → Phenotype: Fy(a-b+)
    *   *FY\*A/FY\*B* → Phenotype: Fy(a+b+)
*   **Prevalence:** Antigen frequencies vary significantly among ethnic populations:
    *   Caucasians: ~66% Fy(a+), ~83% Fy(b+)
    *   Black individuals: ~10% Fy(a+), ~23% Fy(b+) (High prevalence of Fy(a-b-))
    *   Asians: >99% Fy(a+), ~18% Fy(b+)

## **The Null Phenotype: Fy(a-b-)** {-}

This phenotype, where red cells lack both Fy<sup>a</sup> and Fy<sup>b</sup>, is particularly important and has a fascinating molecular basis, especially in African populations:

*   **Common Mechanism (African Ancestry)**
    *   **Genetics:** Most Fy(a-b-) individuals of African descent possess the *FY\*B* allele but have an additional **SNP in the promoter region** of the *DARC* gene, specifically at position -33 (T>C). This mutation occurs within a binding site for the **GATA-1 erythroid transcription factor**
    *   **Biochemistry/Expression:** The GATA-1 factor is essential for gene expression *in red blood cell precursors*. The -33C mutation disrupts GATA-1 binding, **preventing transcription** of the *DARC* gene *only in erythroid cells*. Therefore, DARC protein (carrying the Fy<sup>b</sup> antigen) is **absent from their red blood cells**
    *   **Crucially:** DARC expression is **NOT affected in other tissues** (like endothelial cells) because gene expression there is controlled by different transcription factors. These individuals are often designated as having the *FY\*B<sup>ES</sup>* allele (Erythroid Silent)
    *   **Malaria Resistance:** This RBC-specific absence of DARC confers strong resistance to invasion by *_Plasmodium vivax_*

*   **Rare Mechanisms (Other Populations)**
    *   In other populations (e.g., Caucasians), the rare Fy(a-b-) phenotype usually results from inheriting two non-functional *DARC* alleles with mutations within the **coding sequence** itself (nonsense or frameshift mutations). These individuals lack DARC expression on *all* tissues, not just RBCs

## **Other Duffy Antigens** {-}

*   **Fy3:** A high-prevalence antigen present on cells expressing Fy<sup>a</sup> or Fy<sup>b</sup>. It is likely located on a different part of the DARC protein than the Fy<sup>a</sup>/Fy<sup>b</sup> site. Fy3 is **absent** on RBCs from individuals with the rare Fy(a-b-) phenotype caused by mutations in the coding region. However, Fy3 antigen *is* present (though perhaps weakly) on the RBCs of individuals with the common GATA-box Fy(a-b-) phenotype, as some residual protein might be expressed. Anti-Fy3 is made only by the rare "true null" individuals
*   **Fy5:** Another antigen whose expression seems to depend on an **interaction between the DARC protein and the Rh protein complex**. Fy5 is weakened or absent on Rh<sub>null</sub> cells
*   **Fy6:** An epitope on the DARC protein that appears to be the actual **binding site for _P. vivax_ merozoites**. It is conformation-dependent and sensitive to enzyme treatment

## **Effect of Reagents on Duffy Antigens** {-}

This is a defining characteristic used in antibody identification:

*   **Proteolytic Enzymes (Ficin, Papain, Bromelin):** Duffy antigens (Fy<sup>a</sup>, Fy<sup>b</sup>, Fy6) are **DESTROYED** by common enzyme treatments. The enzymes cleave the DARC protein, removing the antigenic sites
*   **Sulfhydryl Reagents (DTT, 2-ME):** Duffy antigens are **RESISTANT** to treatment with DTT or 2-ME

## **Duffy Antibodies (Anti-Fy<sup>a</sup>, Anti-Fy<sup>b</sup>, Anti-Fy3)** {-}

*   **Type:** Usually **IgG** (often IgG1), reacting best at the **AHG (Coombs) phase**
*   **Stimulation:** Typically **immune stimulated** (require exposure through transfusion or pregnancy). Anti-Fy<sup>a</sup> is encountered more commonly than anti-Fy<sup>b</sup>, likely reflecting antigen prevalence and perhaps slightly higher immunogenicity
*   **Dosage:** Often show **dosage** (react more strongly with homozygous cells)
*   **Complement Activation:** Generally do not activate complement efficiently
*   **Clinical Significance:** **Clinically Significant!**
    *   **Hemolytic Transfusion Reactions (HTRs):** Can cause both acute and delayed HTRs, typically extravascular
    *   **Hemolytic Disease of the Fetus and Newborn (HDFN):** A well-recognized cause of HDFN, which can range from mild to severe
*   **Anti-Fy3:** Rare antibody made by individuals with the "true" Fy(a-b-) null phenotype (coding region mutations). Reacts with almost all cells except those lacking DARC protein. Clinically significant

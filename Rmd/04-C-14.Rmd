# Column Agglutination {-}

**Column Agglutination Technology (CAT)**, often called the **Gel Test™** (which is actually a specific brand name, but frequently used generically) is a really popular and visually elegant alternative to traditional tube testing for many routine and special blood bank procedures!

Think of it as a sophisticated sieve in a tiny tube. Instead of looking for clumps floating in liquid, we see if clumps get trapped in a special gel or bead matrix during centrifugation

## **The Core Purpose: Detecting Agglutination in a Column** {-}

CAT provides a standardized and stable method for performing many common immunohematology tests, including:

*   **ABO Forward and Reverse Grouping**
*   **Rh(D) Typing (including Weak D testing)**
*   **Antibody Screening**
*   **Antibody Identification**
*   **Direct Antiglobulin Test (DAT)**
*   **Compatibility Testing (Crossmatching)**
*   **Red Blood Cell Antigen Typing**

## **The Principle: Sieving Through Gel/Beads** {-}

The magic happens inside specially designed **microtubes** (or "columns") embedded in plastic cards (often 6 microtubes per card)

*   **The Microtube:** The top part is a reaction chamber. Below this, the microtube contains a matrix of either **Sephadex gel** or **glass beads** suspended in a buffered solution. This solution often contains pre-dispensed reagents depending on the test card type (e.g., Anti-A, Anti-B, Anti-D, AHG)
*   **The Process**
    1.  Patient/donor red cells and/or plasma/serum are added to the reaction chamber at the top of the microtube, according to the specific test protocol
    2.  The card is incubated (if required, e.g., for IAT methods at 37°C)
    3.  The card is then **centrifuged** in a special centrifuge designed to hold the cards
*   **The Separation:** During centrifugation:
    *   **Unagglutinated Red Blood Cells:** Are small enough to pass *through* the spaces in the gel/bead matrix and form a compact pellet at the **bottom** of the microtube
    *   **Agglutinated Red Blood Cells:** Form larger clumps that are too big to pass through the matrix. They get **trapped** within the gel/beads at various levels depending on the size and strength of the agglutinates

## **Types of Gel Cards** {-}

Different cards are pre-filled for specific tests:

*   **Neutral/Saline Cards:** Contain only the buffered gel/bead matrix. Used for ABO reverse grouping, autocontrols, or situations where no specific reagent is needed in the column itself
*   **Antisera Cards:** Contain specific blood grouping antisera (like Anti-A, Anti-B, Anti-D) within the gel/matrix. Used for forward ABO/Rh typing
*   **AHG Cards (Anti-Human Globulin):** Contain Anti-IgG (and sometimes Anti-C3d or polyspecific AHG) within the gel/matrix. These are crucial for:
    *   **Indirect Antiglobulin Tests (IAT):** Antibody screen, antibody ID, Weak D, crossmatch. Plasma/serum and cells are incubated *before* being added to the AHG card for centrifugation
    *   **Direct Antiglobulin Test (DAT):** Patient's washed red cells are added directly to the AHG card and centrifuged

## **Reading and Interpreting Results** {-}

This is where CAT really shines due to its clarity and stability:

*   **Negative Reaction (0):** All red blood cells pass through the matrix and form a sharp, compact **pellet at the very bottom** of the microtube. There are no agglutinates trapped in the column
*   **Positive Reaction (1+ to 4+):** Agglutinated cells are trapped within the gel/bead matrix. The **strength** of the reaction correlates with **how high up** the cells are trapped:
    *   **4+:** A solid band of agglutinated cells trapped at the **top** of the gel/bead column
    *   **3+:** Agglutinated cells primarily in the **upper half** of the column
    *   **2+:** Agglutinated cells dispersed throughout the **length** of the column
    *   **1+:** Agglutinated cells mainly in the **lower half** of the column, with some cells possibly reaching the bottom
*   **Mixed Field Reaction:** Characterized by a layer of agglutinated cells trapped at the top or dispersed in the column *and* a pellet of unagglutinated cells at the bottom. Often seen post-transfusion or with certain weak subgroups
*   **Hemolysis:** Hemolysis (due to complement activation, etc.) occurring *before or during* centrifugation is also considered a **positive** result if it's antibody-mediated. The supernatant above the gel/beads may appear pink or red, and there may be fewer intact cells to pellet or get trapped

*(Visualizing this helps! Imagine a clear tube filled with gel/beads. Negative = red dot at bottom. Positive = red line/smear trapped in the gel, higher up = stronger reaction.)*

## **Advantages of Column Agglutination Technology** {-}

*   **Standardization:** Reduces variability associated with tube testing techniques (e.g., inconsistent shaking/resuspension)
*   **Objectivity & Stability:** Results are stable for hours (sometimes days), easy to read, photograph, or review. Grading is generally more consistent between technologists
*   **Sensitivity:** Often considered as sensitive as, or slightly more sensitive than, traditional LISS tube testing for detecting weak IgG antibodies
*   **Reduced Sample Volume:** Can often use smaller amounts of sample/reagents
*   **Automation:** Easily incorporated into semi-automated and fully automated blood bank testing platforms
*   **Safety:** Reduced aerosol production compared to tube methods

## **Disadvantages and Considerations** {-}

*   **Cost:** Cards and specialized centrifuges/incubators can be more expensive than basic tube testing supplies
*   **Specialized Equipment:** Requires dedicated centrifuges and sometimes incubators designed for the cards
*   **Hemolysis Detection:** Detecting *in vitro* hemolysis within the opaque gel column itself can sometimes be harder than seeing it in the supernatant of a tube, though hemolysis above the column is visible
*   **Fibrin/Particulate Interference:** Fibrin strands or other debris in a sample can sometimes get trapped nonspecifically at the top of the gel, potentially mimicking a weak positive reaction. Clean samples are important
*   **Training:** Requires familiarity with the specific reading and grading criteria

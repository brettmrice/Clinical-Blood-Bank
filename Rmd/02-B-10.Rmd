# Lutheran {-}

The **Lutheran blood group system (ISBT 005)**! While not always causing the dramatic reactions seen with ABO or Rh, Lutheran has some unique biochemical features and inheritance patterns that make it fascinating. Its main antigens, **Lu<sup>a</sup> and Lu<sup>b</sup>**, are carried on a protein involved in cell adhesion, and the system is known for its characteristic **mixed-field agglutination** in antibody testing and some interesting rare null phenotypes

## **Genetics: The *BCAM* Gene** {-}

*   The Lutheran antigens are encoded by the ***BCAM* gene:** (Basal Cell Adhesion Molecule), also historically referred to as the *LU* gene
*   Location: This gene resides on **chromosome 19**, interestingly, in the same region as and closely linked to the **Secretor (*FUT2*):** and **Lewis (*FUT3*)** genes

## **Biochemistry: The Lutheran Glycoprotein (B-CAM/LU)** {-}

Lutheran antigens are located on a specific protein with important biological functions:

*   **Structure:** The *BCAM* gene codes for the **Lutheran glycoprotein (B-CAM/LU)**. This is a **Type I transmembrane glycoprotein**, meaning it passes through the red cell membrane once, with its N-terminus outside and C-terminus inside the cell
*   **Family:** B-CAM/LU belongs to the **Immunoglobulin Superfamily (IgSF)**, a large group of cell surface proteins involved in recognition, binding, or adhesion
*   **Function:** B-CAM/LU functions as an **adhesion molecule**. Its primary known ligand (binding partner) is **laminin**, a major component of the extracellular matrix (the "scaffolding" outside cells). This interaction is thought to play a role in:
    *   Red blood cell development and maturation
    *   Maintaining membrane integrity
    *   **Pathophysiology:** Notably, B-CAM/LU mediates the adhesion of **sickle red blood cells** to the endothelium (lining of blood vessels), contributing to the vaso-occlusive events characteristic of sickle cell disease

## **The Major Lutheran Antigens: Lu<sup>a</sup> and Lu<sup>b</sup>** {-}

These are the two primary, antithetical antigens of the system:

*   **Biochemical Difference:** The difference between Lu<sup>a</sup> and Lu<sup>b</sup> arises from a **single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)** in the *BCAM* gene. This SNP results in a single **amino acid substitution** at position 77 of the mature protein:
    *   **Lu<sup>a</sup> (LU1):** Has **Histidine (His)** at position 77
    *   **Lu<sup>b</sup> (LU2):** Has **Arginine (Arg)** at position 77
*   **Prevalence:** This is a key difference!
    *   **Lu<sup>a</sup>:** **Low prevalence** antigen, found in about 8% of Caucasians and less frequently in other populations
    *   **Lu<sup>b</sup>:** **High prevalence** antigen, found in over 99% of most populations
*   **Inheritance:** An individual inherits one *BCAM* allele from each parent, leading to three possible genotypes:
    *   *LU\*A/LU\*A* (Homozygous Lu<sup>a</sup>) → Phenotype: Lu(a+b-) (Rare)
    *   *LU\*B/LU\*B* (Homozygous Lu<sup>b</sup>) → Phenotype: Lu(a-b+) (Common)
    *   *LU\*A/LU\*B* (Heterozygous) → Phenotype: Lu(a+b+) (Uncommon, ~8%)

## **Other Lutheran Antigens** {-}

There are about 20 antigens identified within the Lutheran system. Another important one is:

*   **Lu3:** This is a very **high-prevalence antigen** present on *all* red cells that express *either* Lu<sup>a</sup> or Lu<sup>b</sup> (or both). It is absent only on the cells of individuals with the rare **recessive Lu(a-b-) null phenotype**

## **Lutheran Null Phenotypes: Lu(a-b-)** {-}

Individuals lacking both Lu<sup>a</sup> and Lu<sup>b</sup> are rare, and their phenotype can arise from different genetic mechanisms:

1.  **Recessive Type Lu(a-b-)**
    *   **Genetics:** Caused by inheriting two rare, non-functional (amorph) ***BCAM* alleles**. The *BCAM* gene itself is defective
    *   **Biochemistry:** Results in the **complete absence** of the B-CAM/LU protein from the red cell membrane
    *   **Antibodies:** These individuals can produce **anti-Lu3** if immunized. Anti-Lu3 reacts with all cells except other recessive-type Lu(a-b-) cells
    *   **Clinical:** Usually clinically healthy, RBCs function normally

2.  **Dominant Inhibitor Type Lu(a-b-) (In(Lu))**
    *   **Genetics:** Caused by inheriting a **dominant suppressor gene**, unrelated to the *BCAM* locus. The most common inhibitor is called ***In(Lu)***, which results from mutations in the ***EKLF* (or *KLF1*) gene**. *EKLF* codes for an erythroid transcription factor crucial for the expression of many genes in red cell development
    *   **Biochemistry:** The *BCAM* gene is usually normal, but its **expression is severely reduced** (suppressed) by the faulty *EKLF* transcription factor. These individuals have **trace amounts** of Lutheran protein and other affected antigens (like P1, i, AnWj) on their RBCs
    *   **Antibodies:** Because they have trace amounts of Lutheran protein, they **do not make anti-Lu3**. They are generally non-responsive to Lutheran antigens
    *   **Clinical:** Usually healthy, but may have subtle RBC abnormalities

3.  **X-linked Inhibitor Type Lu(a-b-)**
    *   **Genetics:** An extremely rare mechanism involving an inhibitor gene on the X chromosome (*XS2* locus)
    *   **Biochemistry:** Suppresses Lutheran expression

## **Antigen Expression** {-}

*   Lutheran antigens are **poorly developed at birth**, with cord blood cells often showing weaker reactivity than adult cells
*   Expression strength can vary among adults

## **Effect of Reagents on Lutheran Antigens** {-}

*   **Proteolytic Enzymes (Ficin, Papain):** Lutheran antigens are generally **RESISTANT** to treatment with common enzymes
*   **Sulfhydryl Reagents (DTT, 2-ME):** Lutheran antigens are also generally **RESISTANT** to DTT and 2-ME

## **Lutheran Antibodies (Anti-Lu<sup>a</sup>, Anti-Lu<sup>b</sup>, Anti-Lu3)** {-}

Lutheran antibodies often display a characteristic reactivity pattern:

*   **Mixed-Field Agglutination:** This is a hallmark! Lutheran antibodies often cause agglutination where there are clumps of cells mixed with unagglutinated free cells in the test tube. This appearance can be subtle and easily missed
*   **Anti-Lu<sup>a</sup>**
    *   **Type:** Can be **IgM, IgG, or IgA**, or a mixture. Often "naturally occurring" but can be immune stimulated
    *   **Reactivity:** Often reacts best at **room temperature (IS)** but may persist to 37°C and AHG. Frequently shows mixed-field agglutination
    *   **Clinical Significance:** Generally considered **not clinically significant** or only mildly significant. Rarely causes mild HTRs or HDFN

*   **Anti-Lu<sup>b</sup>**
    *   **Type:** Usually **IgG**, immune stimulated
    *   **Reactivity:** Reacts best at the **AHG phase**. Can show mixed-field agglutination
    *   **Clinical Significance:** **Clinically significant!** Although rare (due to the high prevalence of Lu<sup>b</sup> antigen), anti-Lu<sup>b</sup> can cause HTRs (usually mild to moderate) and mild HDFN

*   **Anti-Lu3**
    *   **Type:** IgG, immune stimulated
    *   **Reactivity:** Reacts at AHG with all cells except recessive Lu(a-b-) cells
    *   **Clinical Significance:** **Clinically significant**. Requires rare Lu(a-b-) blood for transfusion

# Fractionation Products {-}

This section moves beyond the blood components prepared directly in a hospital blood bank (like RBCs, platelets, FFP, Cryo) and delves into highly purified protein products derived from large pools of human plasma through industrial manufacturing processes. These are essentially **plasma-derived pharmaceuticals**

## **What are Fractionation Products?** {-}

*   **Definition:** Therapeutic protein concentrates obtained through a large-scale industrial process called **plasma fractionation**. This process separates and purifies specific proteins from large pools of human plasma collected primarily as **Source Plasma** (via plasmapheresis) or sometimes **Recovered Plasma** (plasma from whole blood donations not used for direct transfusion)
*   **Process (Simplified):** Involves sophisticated biochemical and biophysical techniques, traditionally starting with the **Cohn fractionation** method (using cold ethanol precipitation) and now often incorporating advanced methods like **chromatography** (ion exchange, affinity), **filtration**, and **ultrafiltration**. A critical part of the manufacturing process includes rigorous steps specifically designed to **inactivate or remove viruses** (e.g., solvent/detergent treatment, pasteurization, nanofiltration), providing a very high margin of viral safety compared to single-donor plasma components

## **Key Differences from Standard Blood Components (FFP, Cryo)** {-}

| Feature             | Fractionation Products                     | Standard Plasma Components (FFP, Cryo) |
| :------------------ | :----------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------- |
| **Source**          | Large pools (thousands) of plasma donors | Single donor (or small pool for Cryo)  |
| **Processing**      | Industrial manufacturing (pharmaceutical)  | Blood bank laboratory separation       |
| **Composition**     | Highly purified specific protein(s)        | Mixture of many plasma proteins        |
| **Concentration**   | Standardized, high concentration         | Variable concentration                 |
| **Viral Safety**    | Multiple inactivation/removal steps        | Donor screening & testing only         |
| **Storage**         | Often lyophilized (powder), room temp/fridge | Frozen (FFP, Cryo)                     |
| **Shelf Life**      | Long (often years)                         | 1 year (frozen), short post-thaw       |
| **Volume**          | Small volume for reconstitution            | Larger volume (FFP ~250mL)             |
| **Regulation**      | As specific pharmaceutical drugs           | As blood components                    |

## **Major Plasma Fractionation Products** {-}

Here are some of the most important therapeutic products derived from plasma fractionation:

*   **Albumin**
    *   *Function:* Maintains plasma oncotic pressure (keeps fluid in blood vessels), transports various substances
    *   *Concentrations:* Available typically as 5% (iso-oncotic) and 25% (hyper-oncotic) solutions
    *   *Indications:* Volume expansion (especially 5%), treatment of edema in hypoalbuminemia (e.g., liver disease, nephrotic syndrome), burns, support during plasma exchange
*   **Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG)**
    *   *Function:* Provides passive immunity (contains a broad spectrum of IgG antibodies), also has complex immunomodulatory effects
    *   *Indications:* Primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs), autoimmune disorders (e.g., Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura - ITP, Guillain-Barr√© Syndrome - GBS, Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy - CIDP), Kawasaki disease, prevention/treatment of infections in immunocompromised hosts. (Subcutaneous preparations - SCIG - are also available)
*   **Factor VIII Concentrate**
    *   *Function:* Essential coagulation factor for the intrinsic pathway
    *   *Indications:* Treatment and prevention of bleeding in **Hemophilia A** (Factor VIII deficiency). Largely replaced Cryoprecipitate/FFP for this indication due to purity, standardized dosing, and enhanced viral safety. (Recombinant Factor VIII is also widely used)
*   **Factor IX Concentrate**
    *   *Function:* Essential coagulation factor for the intrinsic pathway
    *   *Indications:* Treatment and prevention of bleeding in **Hemophilia B** (Factor IX deficiency). (Recombinant Factor IX is also widely used)
*   **Prothrombin Complex Concentrates (PCCs)**
    *   *Function:* Contains varying combinations of the Vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors: Factor II (Prothrombin), Factor VII, Factor IX, and Factor X. May also contain anticoagulant proteins C and S
    *   *Types:* 3-Factor PCCs (low Factor VII) and 4-Factor PCCs
    *   *Indications:* Urgent reversal of Warfarin (Coumadin) anticoagulation, treatment of bleeding due to deficiency of one or more Vitamin K-dependent factors (e.g., liver disease, specific factor deficiencies if single concentrates unavailable)
*   **Fibrinogen Concentrate (Factor I Concentrate)**
    *   *Function:* Precursor to fibrin, essential for clot structure
    *   *Indications:* Treatment of bleeding in congenital afibrinogenemia/hypofibrinogenemia or acquired hypofibrinogenemia (e.g., DIC, massive transfusion) when Cryoprecipitate is unavailable or large volumes would be required
*   **Alpha-1 Antitrypsin (AAT)**
    *   *Function:* Inhibits proteases (like neutrophil elastase) in the lungs
    *   *Indications:* Augmentation therapy for patients with congenital AAT deficiency leading to emphysema
*   **Antithrombin (AT) Concentrate (Formerly ATIII)**
    *   *Function:* Major inhibitor of thrombin and other coagulation proteases (natural anticoagulant)
    *   *Indications:* Treatment of hereditary AT deficiency, especially during surgery or pregnancy/delivery
*   **C1 Esterase Inhibitor (C1-INH) Concentrate**
    *   *Function:* Regulates activation of the complement and contact (kallikrein-kinin) systems
    *   *Indications:* Treatment and prevention of attacks in patients with **Hereditary Angioedema (HAE)**

## **Advantages of Fractionation Products** {-}

*   **Targeted Therapy:** Allows replacement of only the specific deficient protein
*   **Enhanced Viral Safety:** Multiple viral inactivation/removal steps significantly reduce the risk of transmitting known viruses
*   **Standardized Dosing:** Products have defined concentrations and activity levels (often in International Units - IU), allowing for precise dosing
*   **Convenience:** Many are lyophilized (freeze-dried powder), allowing for room temperature or refrigerated storage and easier transport/reconstitution compared to frozen plasma products
*   **Reduced Volume:** Provides a therapeutic dose in a much smaller volume than plasma or cryoprecipitate, reducing the risk of circulatory overload

## **Disadvantages / Considerations** {-}

*   **Cost:** Often significantly more expensive than standard plasma components
*   **Source Material:** Reliant on a consistent supply of human plasma donations
*   **Potential for Reactions:** Although highly purified, allergic or anaphylactic reactions can still occur
*   **Thrombotic Risk:** Particularly associated with PCCs due to the concentration of procoagulant factors
*   **Transmission of Novel Pathogens:** While current methods are effective against known viruses, the theoretical risk of transmitting new or prion agents (like vCJD) from pooled plasma, although extremely low, cannot be completely eliminated

## **Key Terms** {-}

*   **Plasma Fractionation:** Industrial process to separate and purify proteins from large pools of plasma
*   **Source Plasma:** Plasma collected via apheresis specifically for manufacturing into derivatives
*   **Recovered Plasma:** Plasma separated from whole blood donations, sometimes used for fractionation
*   **Cohn Fractionation:** Classic method using cold ethanol precipitation
*   **Chromatography:** Purification technique based on differential binding of proteins to a stationary phase
*   **Viral Inactivation/Removal:** Mandatory steps in manufacturing (e.g., solvent/detergent, pasteurization, nanofiltration) to enhance safety
*   **Lyophilized:** Freeze-dried into a powder for stability and reconstitution
*   **International Unit (IU):** Standardized measure of biological activity for many coagulation factors and other proteins
*   **Oncotic Pressure:** Pressure exerted by proteins (especially albumin) in plasma that helps hold fluid within blood vessels

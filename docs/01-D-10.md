# Whole Blood {-}

While **Whole Blood (WB)** was the original product used for transfusion, its use for direct infusion has become relatively uncommon in most developed countries, largely replaced by **component therapy**. However, understanding Whole Blood is essential for historical context and because it remains the starting material for most blood components and still has niche applications, particularly in massive hemorrhage situations

## **What is Whole Blood?** {-}

*   **Definition:** Whole Blood is essentially blood as it is collected from the donor, containing all its primary constituents: Red Blood Cells (RBCs), Plasma, Platelets, and White Blood Cells (WBCs), suspended in an anticoagulant-preservative solution
*   **Composition:** A standard unit contains approximately:
    *   ~450-500 mL of donor blood
    *   ~63-70 mL of anticoagulant-preservative solution (e.g., CPD, CPDA-1)
    *   Total Volume: ~513-570 mL
*   **Key Point:** It contains all components in roughly physiological proportions *at the time of collection*

## **Historical Context & The Shift to Component Therapy** {-}

*   Historically, WB was the only transfusion option available
*   The development of plastic bags with satellite containers and advances in centrifugation techniques allowed for the separation of WB into its constituent parts (RBCs, Platelets, Plasma, Cryoprecipitate)
*   **Reasons for the Shift**
    *   **Targeted Therapy:** Allows clinicians to transfuse only the specific component the patient needs, avoiding unnecessary volume and constituents
    *   **Optimal Storage:** Different components require different storage conditions for maximum viability and function (e.g., RBCs at 1-6°C, Platelets at 20-24°C, Plasma frozen)
    *   **Reduced Wastage:** Prevents discarding functional components when only one part of the WB unit is needed
    *   **Concentration:** Allows for concentrated doses (e.g., apheresis platelets, cryoprecipitate)
    *   **Reduced Adverse Reactions:** Giving fewer unnecessary plasma proteins or WBCs can reduce allergic and febrile reactions

## **Preparation (Collection)** {-}

*   Collected via standard venipuncture into a primary collection bag containing anticoagulant-preservative solution (CPD, CPDA-1)
*   **Crucial Distinction:** While most blood donations *start* as Whole Blood collection, the vast majority are processed into components within hours. Units intended for transfusion *as* Whole Blood are specifically designated and stored as such

## **Indications for Transfusion** {-}

The use of Whole Blood for direct transfusion is now limited primarily to:

*   **Massive Hemorrhage / Trauma Resuscitation:** Especially in military settings or trauma centers adopting "balanced resuscitation" strategies. The rationale is to replace lost blood with a product containing oxygen-carrying capacity (RBCs), volume and clotting factors (plasma), and some platelets, potentially closer to physiological ratios than combining separate components. Often, "fresh" whole blood (collected <24 hours prior) is desired in these settings to maximize platelet and factor function, though this presents significant logistical challenges
*   **Neonatal Exchange Transfusion:** Sometimes used, though often reconstituted WB (RBCs + FFP) or RBCs alone are used
*   **Resource-Limited Settings:** May be used more commonly where the capacity for component preparation is limited

## **Storage and Expiration** {-}

This is a key limitation of Whole Blood:

*   **Storage Temperature:** **1°C to 6°C** (same as RBCs)
*   **Expiration:** Determined by the anticoagulant-preservative solution:
    *   CPD or CP2D: **21 days**
    *   CPDA-1: **35 days**
*   **Critical Limitations due to Storage Temperature**
    *   **Platelet Function:** Platelets rapidly lose viability and function when stored at 1-6°C. After 24-48 hours, stored WB contains very few functional platelets
    *   **Labile Coagulation Factors:** Factors V and VIII degrade significantly at refrigerated temperatures over time. Stored WB is a poor source of these factors compared to FFP
    *   **WBC Viability:** Leukocytes also lose function, though their presence contributes to risks like alloimmunization and FNHTRs

## **Advantages (in Specific Contexts)** {-}

*   **Balanced Resuscitation:** In massive hemorrhage, potentially provides a more physiologically balanced replacement fluid compared to crystalloids or just RBCs initially
*   **Logistical Simplicity:** One product to store and transfuse instead of coordinating three (RBCs, plasma, platelets) – relevant in emergencies or remote settings
*   **Reduced Donor Exposure (Potentially):** Receiving one WB unit exposes the recipient to one donor, whereas receiving individual components *might* involve multiple donors (though apheresis components mitigate this)

## **Disadvantages (Why Component Therapy is Preferred)** {-}

*   **Suboptimal Component Viability:** Platelets and labile factors (V, VIII) are poorly preserved at 1-6°C
*   **Component Wastage:** Transfusing unnecessary components (e.g., giving plasma and non-functional platelets to a patient who only needs RBCs)
*   **Circulatory Overload Risk:** Larger infusion volume compared to packed RBCs, potentially problematic for patients sensitive to volume (e.g., cardiac or renal patients)
*   **Increased Risk of Certain Reactions:** Contains more plasma proteins (higher risk of allergic reactions) and non-functional leukocytes (higher risk of FNHTRs, alloimmunization, CMV transmission) compared to leukoreduced, plasma-reduced components
*   **Storage Incompatibility:** No single temperature optimally preserves all components simultaneously

## **Modifications** {-}

*   **Leukoreduction:** Whole Blood *can* be leukoreduced using appropriate filters, though this is less common than LR for components
*   **Irradiation:** Can be irradiated for the same indications as RBCs/Platelets (preventing TA-GVHD). Irradiation imposes the same expiration constraint (original outdate or 28 days post-irradiation, whichever is sooner)

## **Administration** {-}

*   **Compatibility:** **MUST be ABO identical** with the recipient. This means the donor's red cells must be compatible with the recipient's plasma, *and* the donor's plasma must be compatible with the recipient's red cells. Rh compatibility is also required
*   **Crossmatch:** A crossmatch is required before transfusion
*   **Filtration:** Administered through a standard blood filter (170-260 microns)
*   **Infusion Time:** Must be completed within **4 hours** of removal from controlled storage

## **Potential Risks / Adverse Reactions** {-}

Includes the risks associated with all components:

*   Hemolytic Transfusion Reactions (Acute and Delayed)
*   Febrile Non-Hemolytic Transfusion Reactions (FNHTRs)
*   Allergic Reactions (Mild to Anaphylaxis)
*   Transfusion-Associated Circulatory Overload (TACO)
*   Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI)
*   Septic Reactions (Bacterial Contamination)
*   Alloimmunization (RBC, HLA, Platelet antigens)
*   Disease Transmission
*   TA-GVHD (if not irradiated when indicated)

## **Key Terms** {-}

*   **Component Therapy:** The practice of transfusing specific blood components (RBCs, Platelets, Plasma) rather than Whole Blood
*   **Anticoagulant-Preservative Solution:** Solutions like CPD, CPDA-1 used in collection bags
*   **Massive Hemorrhage:** Acute, severe blood loss requiring large-volume transfusion
*   **Balanced Resuscitation:** Transfusion strategy aiming to replace lost blood with components (or WB) in a ratio approximating physiological levels
*   **Labile Factors:** Coagulation Factors V and VIII, which degrade relatively quickly at refrigerated temperatures
*   **ABO Identical:** Donor and recipient have the same ABO group (required for WB transfusion)

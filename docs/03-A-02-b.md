# Structure {-}

Understanding immunoglobulinstheir structure is absolutely fundamental because *how* they are built directly dictates *what* they can do – like binding specific antigens on red cells, activating complement, or crossing the placenta

Think of the basic immunoglobulin molecule as a flexible, Y-shaped protein. This shape isn't accidental; it's perfectly designed for its dual roles: recognizing and binding a specific target (antigen) and then signaling to other parts of the immune system to take action

Here's a breakdown of the key structural components:

## **Basic Building Blocks: Polypeptide Chains** {-}

Every basic immunoglobulin unit (monomer) is built from four polypeptide chains:

*  **Two Identical Heavy (H) Chains:** These are the larger chains (~50-77 kDa each). They form the backbone of the "Y" shape, including the entire stem and part of the arms
    *   The type of Heavy chain determines the **class (isotype):** of the immunoglobulin:
        *   Gamma (γ) -> IgG
        *   Mu (μ) -> IgM
        *   Alpha (α) -> IgA
        *   Delta (δ) -> IgD
        *   Epsilon (ε) -> IgE
*  **Two Identical Light (L) Chains:** These are smaller chains (~25 kDa each). Each light chain is bound to one of the heavy chains, forming the outer part of the "Y" arms
    *   There are two types (isotypes) of Light chains:
        *   **Kappa (κ)**
        *   **Lambda (λ)**
    *   Any single antibody molecule will have *either* two kappa chains *or* two lambda chains, never a mix. In humans, about 60% of antibodies have kappa chains and 40% have lambda chains

## **Holding it Together: Disulfide Bonds** {-}

These polypeptide chains are held together by strong covalent bonds called **disulfide bonds (-S-S-)**:

*   **Inter-chain disulfide bonds:** Link the heavy chains to each other (usually in the hinge region) and link each heavy chain to its corresponding light chain
*   **Intra-chain disulfide bonds:** Occur *within* each individual heavy and light chain, creating loops. These loops fold into compact, stable structures called **domains**

## **Functional Regions: Variable and Constant** {-}

Each heavy and light chain can be conceptually divided into two main regions:

*  **Variable (V) Region**
    *   **Location:** Found at the tips of the "Y" arms (the N-terminal end of both H and L chains)
    *   **Composition:** Consists of one variable domain on the light chain (**V<sub>L</sub>**) and one variable domain on the heavy chain (**V<sub>H</sub>**)
    *   **Function:** This region is highly variable in its amino acid sequence, especially within specific segments called **Hypervariable Regions** or **Complementarity-Determining Regions (CDRs)**. This variability creates the unique, three-dimensional **antigen-binding site**. Each basic antibody unit has *two identical* antigen-binding sites, one at the tip of each arm. This is where the antibody recognizes and physically binds to its specific antigen (like the D antigen on a red cell). The incredible diversity here is generated by V(D)J gene rearrangement
*  **Constant (C) Region**
    *   **Location:** Makes up the rest of the light chain and the stem and lower part of the arms of the heavy chains (the C-terminal end)
    *   **Composition:** Consists of one constant domain on the light chain (**C<sub>L</sub>**) and multiple constant domains on the heavy chain (**C<sub>H</sub>1, C<sub>H</sub>2, C<sub>H</sub>3** - and sometimes **C<sub>H</sub>4** in IgM and IgE)
    *   **Function:** The amino acid sequence in this region is relatively constant within each class and subclass. It determines the antibody's class (IgG, IgM, etc.) and mediates its **effector functions** – how the antibody interacts with other immune system components after binding antigen. This includes:
        *   Binding to **Fc receptors:** on cells like macrophages, neutrophils, NK cells, and mast cells
        *   Activating the **complement system:** (primarily via the C<sub>H</sub>2 domain of IgG and C<sub>H</sub>3 of IgM)
        *   Determining if the antibody can **cross the placenta:** (mediated by Fc receptors on placental cells binding the IgG Fc region)

## **Key Structural Domains** {-}

As mentioned, the chains fold into distinct globular domains:

*   **Light Chain:** V<sub>L</sub>, C<sub>L</sub>
*   **Heavy Chain:** V<sub>H</sub>, C<sub>H</sub>1, C<sub>H</sub>2, C<sub>H</sub>3 (and C<sub>H</sub>4 for IgM/IgE)

Each domain has a characteristic "immunoglobulin fold" structure

## **Functional Fragments: Fab and Fc** {-}

Experimentally, enzymes like papain can cleave the antibody molecule into distinct fragments, which helps us understand its function:

*  **Fab (Fragment, antigen-binding)**
    *   **Structure:** Consists of one complete light chain (V<sub>L</sub> + C<sub>L</sub>) paired with the V<sub>H</sub> and C<sub>H</sub>1 domains of one heavy chain. Essentially, one "arm" of the Y
    *   **Function:** Contains the antigen-binding site. Each monomeric antibody has *two* Fab fragments
*  **Fc (Fragment, crystallizable)**
    *   **Structure:** Consists of the constant region domains from the stem of the two heavy chains (C<sub>H</sub>2 and C<sub>H</sub>3 domains, or C<sub>H</sub>2, C<sub>H</sub>3, C<sub>H</sub>4 for IgM/IgE)
    *   **Function:** Contains the sites responsible for most effector functions (complement activation, Fc receptor binding, placental transfer). It's the "business end" that interacts with the rest of the immune system

## **The Hinge Region** {-}

*   **Location:** Found between the C<sub>H</sub>1 and C<sub>H</sub>2 domains of the heavy chains in IgG, IgA, and IgD
*   **Structure:** A flexible stretch of amino acids, rich in proline and cysteine residues (which form the inter-chain disulfide bonds holding the heavy chains together here)
*   **Function:** Allows the two Fab arms to move independently, like hinges on a door. This flexibility is important for allowing the antibody to bind effectively to antigens that might be spaced at different distances on a cell surface or pathogen
*   **Note:** IgM and IgE lack a hinge region but have an extra constant domain (C<sub>H</sub>4) instead, which may provide some structural spacing

## **Carbohydrates (Glycosylation)** {-}

Immunoglobulins are glycoproteins, meaning they have carbohydrate chains attached, typically to the constant regions (especially C<sub>H</sub>2). These carbohydrates are important for:

*   Proper folding and assembly of the antibody
*   Solubility
*   Stability and protection from degradation
*   Modulating Fc-mediated effector functions (influencing binding to Fc receptors and complement)

## **Overall Structures (Relating to Classes)** {-}

While the basic Y-shape is the monomer unit, some classes exist as polymers:

*   **Monomer:** IgG, IgD, IgE (and membrane-bound IgM/IgA) - The basic 4-chain (2H+2L) structure
*   **Dimer:** Secretory IgA - Two monomer units linked by a **J-chain** and associated with a **Secretory Component**
*   **Pentamer:** IgM (secreted form) - Five monomer units linked by disulfide bonds and a central **J-chain**. This structure gives IgM 10 potential antigen-binding sites (though usually only 5 are readily available due to steric hindrance) and makes it exceptionally good at agglutination and complement activation

## **Blood Bank Relevance Summary** {-}

*   **Antigen Binding (Fab):** The specificity of the V regions dictates which blood group antigen (e.g., D, K, Fy<sup>a</sup>) an antibody will bind
*   **Agglutination:** The structure (monomer vs. pentamer) influences agglutination ability. Pentameric IgM is a much better agglutinator (visible clumping) than monomeric IgG
*   **Complement Activation (Fc):** The structure of the Fc region (specifically C<sub>H</sub>2/C<sub>H</sub>3) determines if and how well an antibody activates complement (IgM > IgG3 > IgG1). This relates directly to the potential for *intravascular hemolysis*
*   **Placental Transfer (Fc):** The IgG Fc structure allows it to bind FcRn receptors and cross the placenta, leading to HDFN if the antibody targets fetal antigens
*   **Detection Methods (Overall Structure):** Small monomeric IgG often requires enhancement techniques (like the Antiglobulin test using anti-IgG) to be detected, whereas large IgM can often cause direct agglutination
*   **Extravascular Hemolysis (Fc):** The Fc region of IgG binds to Fc receptors on macrophages in the spleen and liver, leading to the removal of antibody-coated red cells

## **Key Terms** {-}

*   **Heavy Chain (H Chain):** The larger polypeptide chain in an antibody (~50-77 kDa); its constant region determines the antibody's class (isotype: γ, μ, α, δ, ε)
*   **Light Chain (L Chain):** The smaller polypeptide chain in an antibody (~25 kDa); exists as either kappa (κ) or lambda (λ) isotype
*   **Disulfide Bonds:** Covalent bonds (-S-S-) linking cysteine amino acids; crucial for holding the H and L chains together (inter-chain) and maintaining the folded structure of domains (intra-chain)
*   **Variable Region (V Region):** The N-terminal portion of H and L chains (V<sub>H</sub> and V<sub>L</sub> domains) characterized by high amino acid sequence variability; forms the antigen-binding site
*   **Constant Region (C Region):** The C-terminal portion of H and L chains (C<sub>L</sub>, C<sub>H</sub>1, C<sub>H</sub>2, C<sub>H</sub>3, C<sub>H</sub>4 domains) with relatively stable amino acid sequences within a class; mediates effector functions
*   **Domain:** A distinct, compact globular structural unit within a polypeptide chain, formed by intra-chain disulfide bonds (e.g., V<sub>L</sub>, C<sub>L</sub>, V<sub>H</sub>, C<sub>H</sub>1, C<sub>H</sub>2, C<sub>H</sub>3)
*   **Fab Fragment (Fragment, antigen-binding):** One arm of the antibody "Y" (composed of V<sub>L</sub>, C<sub>L</sub>, V<sub>H</sub>, C<sub>H</sub>1), containing one antigen-binding site
*   **Fc Fragment (Fragment, crystallizable):** The stem of the antibody "Y" (composed of C<sub>H</sub>2 and C<sub>H</sub>3 domains, +/- C<sub>H</sub>4), responsible for effector functions like complement activation and binding to cellular Fc receptors
*   **Hinge Region:** A flexible segment between the C<sub>H</sub>1 and C<sub>H</sub>2 domains in IgG, IgA, and IgD, allowing movement of the Fab arms
*   **J-Chain:** A polypeptide that links monomers together in polymeric immunoglobulins (IgM pentamer, IgA dimer)
*   **Antigen-Binding Site:** The specific pocket or surface within the Variable regions (formed by V<sub>H</sub> and V<sub>L</sub>) that physically interacts with and binds the antigen epitope. Each basic antibody monomer has two identical sites

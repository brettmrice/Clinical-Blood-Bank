# MNS {-}

The **MNS blood group system (ISBT 002)** is a complex system characterized by antigens located on two major red blood cell **sialoglycoproteins**: Glycophorin A (GPA) and Glycophorin B (GPB). Unlike ABO or Lewis antigens which are carbohydrates, MNS antigens like the antithetical pairs **M/N** (on GPA) and **S/s** (on GPB) are defined by specific amino acid variations in these proteins, encoded by the closely linked *GYPA* and *GYPB* genes. The system also includes the high-prevalence U antigen, also on GPB, and numerous variants arising from genetic mutations and rearrangements, with antibodies like anti-S, anti-s, and anti-U holding significant clinical importance

## **The Players: Glycophorin A (GPA) and Glycophorin B (GPB)** {-}

The MNS antigens are located on two important **sialoglycoproteins** (proteins with lots of sialic acid-containing sugar chains attached) that span the red blood cell membrane:

*   **Glycophorin A (GPA)**
    *   The **major:** sialoglycoprotein on the RBC surface (about 1 million copies per cell)
    *   Encoded by the ***GYPA* gene:** on chromosome 4
    *   Carries the **M and N antigens**
    *   Heavily glycosylated, contributing significantly to the RBC's negative surface charge (due to sialic acid). This charge helps keep RBCs from sticking together
    *   May serve as receptors for certain pathogens (like *Plasmodium falciparum*) and cytokines

*   **Glycophorin B (GPB)**
    *   Structurally similar to the N-terminal portion of GPA but present in fewer copies (about 200,000 per cell)
    *   Encoded by the ***GYPB* gene**, located very close to *GYPA* on chromosome 4 (this linkage is important for inheritance)
    *   Carries the **S, s, and U antigens**
    *   Also glycosylated and contributes to the negative surface charge

## **Genetics Recap: Linked Genes** {-}

*   *GYPA* and *GYPB* are tightly linked on chromosome 4
*   This means they are usually inherited together as a **haplotype:** (e.g., *MS*, *Ms*, *NS*, *Ns*)

## **Biochemistry of Antigen Specificity** {-}

The differences between the M/N and S/s antigens are determined by variations in the **amino acid sequences** of GPA and GPB, caused by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the *GYPA* and *GYPB* genes

*   **M and N Antigens (on GPA)**
    *   The difference between M and N lies at **positions 1 and 5:** of the GPA protein sequence (at the N-terminus, sticking out from the cell)
    *   **M Antigen:** Has **Serine** at position 1 and **Glycine** at position 5
    *   **N Antigen:** Has **Leucine** at position 1 and **Glutamic Acid** at position 5
    *   These are **antithetical:** antigens – an individual inherits the genetic information to produce either M or N GPA from each chromosome 4. Genotypes can be *MM*, *MN*, or *NN*

*   **S and s Antigens (on GPB)**
    *   The difference between S and s lies at **position 29:** of the GPB protein sequence
    *   **S Antigen:** Has **Methionine** at position 29
    *   **s Antigen:** Has **Threonine** at position 29
    *   These are also **antithetical:** antigens. Genotypes can be *SS*, *Ss*, or *ss*

## **The U Antigen (on GPB)** {-}

*   **Location:** Located on GPB, closer to the red cell membrane than the S/s antigens. It requires the presence of a significant portion of the GPB protein structure
*   **Prevalence:** A **very high-prevalence antigen**, present on the RBCs of over 99.9% of individuals in most populations
*   **U-Negative Phenotype**
    *   Individuals lack the U antigen. This phenotype is **rare**, found almost exclusively in individuals of **African descent:** (about 1% prevalence in this population)
    *   Usually results from **deletion or mutations:** in the ***GYPB* gene**, leading to the absence or severe truncation of GPB
    *   Because S and s are also on GPB, U-negative individuals are almost always **S-s-:** as well
    *   *Clinical Significance:* U-negative individuals can form **anti-U**, which is a clinically significant antibody capable of causing severe HTRs and HDFN. Finding U-negative blood for transfusion is extremely challenging

## **Common Haplotypes and Phenotypes** {-}

Due to the linkage of *GYPA* and *GYPB*, certain combinations of antigens are inherited together:

*   **Common Haplotypes:** *MS*, *Ms*, *NS*, *Ns*
*   **Resulting Genotypes:** An individual inherits one haplotype from each parent (e.g., *MS/Ms*, *MS/NS*, *Ns/Ns*)
*   **Phenotype:** The combination of antigens detected on the cells (e.g., M+N+S+s+)

## **Effect of Proteolytic Enzymes (Ficin, Papain)** {-}

Enzyme treatment is a key tool in antibody identification involving the MNS system:

*   **M and N Antigens:** Located on the outer portion of GPA, which is easily cleaved off by enzymes like ficin and papain. Therefore, M and N antigens are **DESTROYED** by enzyme treatment
*   **S and s Antigens:** Located on GPB. Their susceptibility to enzymes is more **VARIABLE**. S is often more sensitive than s, but both can be weakened or sometimes resistant depending on the specific enzyme and conditions. They are generally considered more resistant than M and N
*   **U Antigen:** Being closer to the membrane on GPB, the U antigen is generally **RESISTANT** to enzyme treatment

## **Dosage Effect** {-}

Antibodies in the MNS system (especially anti-M, -N, -S, -s) often show **dosage**. This means they react more strongly with red cells that are homozygous for the corresponding antigen compared to heterozygous cells

*   *Example:* Anti-M may react 3+ with M+N- cells (genotype *MM*) but only 1+ with M+N+ cells (genotype *MN*)

## **MNS Antibodies: A Quick Overview** {-}

*   **Anti-M**
    *   Commonly encountered "naturally occurring" antibody
    *   Often **IgM**, reactive at room temperature or below (IS phase)
    *   Usually **clinically insignificant:** unless reactive at 37°C/AHG
    *   Frequently shows dosage
    *   pH dependent (enhanced reactivity at pH 6.5)
*   **Anti-N**
    *   Less common than anti-M
    *   Usually **IgM**, cold-reactive, clinically insignificant
    *   Often shows dosage
    *   A rare "dialysis-associated" anti-N form can be seen (reacts with formaldehyde-treated N+ cells)
*   **Anti-S**
    *   Usually **IgG**, reactive at 37°C and/or AHG phase
    *   **Clinically significant:** Can cause HTRs and HDFN

*   **Anti-s**
    *   Usually **IgG**, reactive at 37°C and/or AHG phase
    *   **Clinically significant:** Can cause HTRs and HDFN
    *   Can show dosage
*   **Anti-U**
    *   Rare antibody found in U-negative (S-s-) individuals
    *   Usually **IgG**, reactive at 37°C/AHG
    *   **Clinically significant:** Associated with severe HTRs and HDFN. Requires rare U-negative blood for transfusion

## **Other MNS Variants** {-}

Numerous other antigens exist within the MNS system (over 40!), often resulting from:

*   Mutations in *GYPA* or *GYPB*
*   Gene rearrangements or unequal crossing-over events between *GYPA* and *GYPB*, leading to hybrid glycophorin molecules (e.g., the Miltenberger subsystem antigens)
*   Null phenotypes (e.g., M<sup>k</sup>M<sup>k</sup> genotype results in lack of GPA and GPB)

## **Key Terms** {-}

*   **Glycophorin A (GPA):** Major RBC sialoglycoprotein carrying M and N antigens
*   **Glycophorin B (GPB):** Minor RBC sialoglycoprotein carrying S, s, and U antigens
*   ***GYPA* & *GYPB*:** Genes encoding GPA and GPB, respectively, located on chromosome 4
*   **Sialoglycoprotein:** A protein with attached sialic acid-containing carbohydrate chains
*   **Antithetical Antigens:** Antigens encoded by alleles at the same locus (M/N, S/s)
*   **Haplotype:** A set of linked genes inherited together (e.g., *Ms*)
*   **U Antigen:** High-prevalence antigen on GPB; absence (U-negative) is rare and associated with lack of GPB
*   **Dosage Effect:** Stronger serological reaction with cells homozygous for an antigen compared to heterozygous cells
*   **Enzyme Treatment:** Use of proteolytic enzymes (ficin, papain) to modify antigen expression; M/N are destroyed, S/s/U are generally more resistant

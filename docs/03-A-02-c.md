# Properties {-}

Understanding the biologic and physical properties of immunoglobulins is key because they explain *why* different antibody classes behave the way they do in the body and in our test tubes. It's the link between their structure and their function, which directly impacts things like hemolysis, placental transfer, and how we detect them in the lab

Think of it like this: knowing a tool's size, shape, and material (physical properties) helps you understand what jobs it's good for (biologic properties). Same idea with antibodies!

Here's a breakdown by class, focusing on the properties most relevant to us:

## **Immunoglobulin G (IgG)** {-}

*   **Physical Properties**
    *   **Structure:** Monomer (basic Y-shape)
    *   **Size/MW:** Relatively small (~150 kDa)
    *   **Sedimentation Coefficient:** 7S (a measure related to size and shape)
    *   **Stability:** Generally stable; can withstand some temperature variations
*   **Biologic Properties**
    *   **Concentration:** Highest concentration in serum
    *   **Location:** Found in blood, lymph, and tissue fluids (can easily move between them due to size)
    *   **Antigen Binding:** Binds antigen via Fab regions. Usually has high affinity, especially in secondary responses
    *   **Agglutination:** Generally **poor agglutinator** on its own ("incomplete antibody"). Its monomeric structure means the two binding sites often can't bridge the distance between red cells suspended in saline (due to the cells' negative surface charge creating repulsion - the zeta potential). Requires enhancement techniques (LISS, PEG) or antiglobulin reagent (anti-IgG) for detection in vitro
    *   **Complement Activation:** **Can activate** the classical complement pathway, but usually requires *two* IgG molecules to bind close together on the cell surface. Subclasses differ: IgG3 > IgG1 >> IgG2 (IgG4 does not activate classical pathway). This can lead to *extravascular* or sometimes *intravascular* hemolysis
    *   **Opsonization:** The Fc region binds effectively to Fc receptors (FcγR) on phagocytes (macrophages, neutrophils). This coating (opsonization) flags antibody-coated cells (like red cells) for destruction, primarily in the spleen and liver (*extravascular hemolysis*)
    *   **Placental Transfer:** **Actively transported** across the placenta via Fc receptors (FcRn) on placental cells. This is unique to IgG! Provides passive immunity to the fetus/newborn but is also the mechanism for **HDFN**. Subclasses vary slightly (IgG1/IgG3 cross best)
    *   **Half-life:** Longest half-life (~23 days), providing sustained protection

## **Immunoglobulin M (IgM)** {-}

*   **Physical Properties**
    *   **Structure:** Large Pentamer (five Y-units joined by J-chain)
    *   **Size/MW:** Very large (~900 kDa)
    *   **Sedimentation Coefficient:** 19S
    *   **Stability:** Disulfide bonds holding the pentamer together can be broken by reducing agents (like DTT or 2-ME), which can be useful in the lab to differentiate IgM from IgG activity
*   **Biologic Properties**
    *   **Concentration:** Lower than IgG in serum
    *   **Location:** Mostly confined to the **intravascular space** (bloodstream) due to its large size
    *   **Antigen Binding:** Pentameric structure gives it 10 potential antigen-binding sites (high **valency**). Even if individual site affinity is low (common in primary response), the overall binding strength (**avidity**) can be high due to multiple attachments
    *   **Agglutination:** **Excellent agglutinator** ("complete antibody"). Its large size and multiple binding sites can easily bridge the distance between red cells, causing visible clumping even in saline, often at room temperature or colder
    *   **Complement Activation:** **Most efficient activator** of the classical complement pathway. The pentameric structure allows the Fc regions to readily bind C1q, initiating the cascade. This can lead to potent **intravascular hemolysis**
    *   **Opsonization:** Generally less effective at direct opsonization via Fc receptors compared to IgG, but potent complement activation leads to C3b coating, which *is* strongly opsonic (via complement receptors on phagocytes)
    *   **Placental Transfer:** **Does NOT cross the placenta** (too large). Therefore, maternal IgM antibodies do not cause HDFN
    *   **Half-life:** Shortest half-life (~5 days)

## **Immunoglobulin A (IgA)** {-}

*   **Physical Properties**
    *   **Structure:** Monomer in serum; Dimer (with J-chain and Secretory Component) in secretions
    *   **Size/MW:** Monomer ~160 kDa (7S); Dimer ~385 kDa (11S)
*   **Biologic Properties**
    *   **Location:** Predominant Ig in **mucosal secretions** (tears, saliva, gut, respiratory tract, milk). Also present in serum
    *   **Transport:** Dimeric IgA is actively transported across epithelial cells into secretions, facilitated by the Secretory Component (which also protects it from digestion)
    *   **Function:** **Mucosal immunity** - prevents pathogen attachment (immune exclusion). Neutralizes toxins locally
    *   **Complement Activation:** Does **NOT** activate the classical pathway; may activate the alternative pathway weakly
    *   **Placental Transfer:** **Does NOT** cross the placenta
    *   **Blood Bank Relevance:** Primarily related to **IgA deficiency**. IgA-deficient patients can make anti-IgA (usually IgG class) which can cause severe **anaphylactic transfusion reactions** upon exposure to IgA in blood products

## **Immunoglobulin E (IgE)** {-}

*   **Physical Properties**
    *   **Structure:** Monomer
    *   **Size/MW:** Slightly larger than IgG (~190 kDa, 8S)
    *   **Stability:** Most heat-labile Ig
*   **Biologic Properties**
    *   **Concentration:** Lowest concentration in serum
    *   **Location:** Most IgE is tightly bound to Fc receptors (FcεRI) on **mast cells** and **basophils** in tissues
    *   **Function:** Triggers **allergic reactions**. When antigen (allergen) cross-links IgE on mast cells, it causes degranulation and release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Also involved in defense against parasites
    *   **Complement Activation:** Does **NOT** activate complement
    *   **Placental Transfer:** **Does NOT** cross the placenta
    *   **Blood Bank Relevance:** Responsible for **allergic transfusion reactions** (urticaria/hives); severe anaphylaxis is possible but less common than with anti-IgA

## **Immunoglobulin D (IgD)** {-}

*   **Physical Properties**
    *   **Structure:** Monomer
    *   **Size/MW:** ~185 kDa, 7S
*   **Biologic Properties**
    *   **Concentration:** Very low in serum
    *   **Location:** Primarily found on the surface of **naive B lymphocytes** (along with IgM) as a B cell receptor (BCR)
    *   **Function:** Involved in signaling for B cell activation and differentiation. Serum function unclear
    *   **Complement Activation:** Does **NOT** activate complement
    *   **Placental Transfer:** **Does NOT** cross the placenta
    *   **Blood Bank Relevance:** No known direct role in transfusion reactions or testing

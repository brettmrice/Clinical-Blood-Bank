# Kidd {-}

While the **Kidd blood group system (ISBT 009)** not as immunogenic as RhD or Kell's K antigen upon initial exposure, Kidd antigens **(Jk<sup>a</sup> and Jk<sup>b</sup>)** are critical players in transfusion medicine. These antigens are actually part of the **urea transporter protein (UT-B)** found on red blood cells, encoded by the *SLC14A1* gene. The real clinical impact comes from the **Kidd antibodies**, which are infamous for causing **delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions (DHTRs)** due to their tendency to decline below detectable levels and then reappear strongly upon re-exposure, often efficiently activating complement

## **Genetics: The *SLC14A1* Gene** {-}

*   The Kidd antigens are encoded by the ***SLC14A1* gene:** (Solute Carrier family 14, member 1), located on **chromosome 18**
*   This gene codes for a protein responsible for urea transport in red blood cells and the kidney

## **Biochemistry: The Kidd Glycoprotein (Urea Transporter B, UT-B)** {-}

Unlike systems defined by enzymes adding sugars (ABO, Lewis) or large structural proteins (Rh, Kell), the Kidd antigens reside on a specific functional protein:

*   **Structure:** The *SLC14A1* gene codes for the **Kidd glycoprotein**, also known as **Urea Transporter B (UT-B)**. This is a **multi-pass transmembrane protein**, meaning it weaves back and forth through the red blood cell membrane multiple times (likely 10 loops)
*   **Function:** Its primary job is to facilitate the rapid transport of **urea** across the red blood cell membrane. This is important for maintaining osmotic stability when RBCs pass through the high urea concentrations in the kidney medulla. It also plays a role in the kidney's ability to concentrate urine
*   **Antigen Location:** The Jk<sup>a</sup> and Jk<sup>b</sup> antigenic determinants are part of the protein structure itself, exposed on the external loops of the protein

## **The Major Kidd Antigens: Jk<sup>a</sup> and Jk<sup>b</sup>** {-}

These are the two principal, antithetical antigens of the system:

*   **Biochemical Difference:** The difference between Jk<sup>a</sup> and Jk<sup>b</sup> arises from a **single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)** in the *SLC14A1* gene. This SNP results in a single **amino acid substitution** at position 280 of the Kidd protein:
    *   **Jk<sup>a</sup> (JK1):** Has **Aspartic Acid (Asp)** at position 280
    *   **Jk<sup>b</sup> (JK2):** Has **Asparagine (Asn)** at position 280
*   **Inheritance:** An individual inherits one *SLC14A1* allele from each parent, leading to three possible genotypes:
    *   *JK\*A/JK\*A* (Homozygous Jk<sup>a</sup>) → Phenotype: Jk(a+b-)
    *   *JK\*B/JK\*B* (Homozygous Jk<sup>b</sup>) → Phenotype: Jk(a-b+)
    *   *JK\*A/JK\*B* (Heterozygous) → Phenotype: Jk(a+b+)
*   **Prevalence:** Both Jk<sup>a</sup> and Jk<sup>b</sup> are common antigens, but their frequencies vary among ethnic populations:
    *   Caucasians: ~77% Jk(a+), ~73% Jk(b+)
    *   Black individuals: ~91% Jk(a+), ~49% Jk(b+)
    *   Asians: ~73% Jk(a+), ~76% Jk(b+)

## **The Jk3 Antigen** {-}

*   **Description:** Jk3 is a **high-prevalence antigen** present whenever **either Jk<sup>a</sup> or Jk<sup>b</sup> antigens** (or both) are expressed. Think of it as being associated with the common structure of the Kidd protein when it carries either the Asp280 or Asn280 residue
*   **Absence:** Jk3 is *absent* only on the red cells of rare **Jk(a-b-)** individuals

## **The Null Phenotype: Jk(a-b-)** {-}

*   **Description:** A rare phenotype where individuals lack expression of Jk<sup>a</sup>, Jk<sup>b</sup>, and Jk3 antigens on their red blood cells
*   **Genetics:** Often caused by inheriting two non-functional *SLC14A1* alleles. A common mechanism, especially in individuals of **Polynesian, Filipino, or Finnish** descent, is homozygosity for a specific **splice site mutation** in the *SLC14A1* gene that prevents proper protein formation. Other mutations can also cause the null phenotype
*   **Biochemistry/Physiology:** Since the Kidd protein (UT-B) is absent or non-functional, these individuals' red cells cannot transport urea rapidly. While generally healthy, they exhibit a **defect in maximal urinary concentrating ability**
*   **Antibodies:** Jk(a-b-) individuals, if immunized, can produce **anti-Jk3**. This antibody reacts with all cells positive for Jk<sup>a</sup> or Jk<sup>b</sup> (essentially all cells except other Jk(a-b-) cells). Finding compatible blood is extremely difficult

## **Effect of Reagents on Kidd Antigens** {-}

*   **Proteolytic Enzymes (Ficin, Papain, Bromelin):** Reactivity of Kidd antibodies is often **ENHANCED** by treating test cells with enzymes. This is a key characteristic used in antibody identification! Enzymes likely remove some surrounding structures, making the Kidd antigens more accessible to antibodies
*   **Sulfhydryl Reagents (DTT, 2-ME):** Kidd antigens are generally **RESISTANT** to treatment with DTT or 2-ME

## **Kidd Antibodies (Anti-Jk<sup>a</sup>, Anti-Jk<sup>b</sup>, Anti-Jk3)** {-}

These are the reason the Kidd system demands respect in the blood bank!

*   **Type:** Usually **IgG** (often IgG1 and/or IgG3), reacting best at the **AHG (Coombs) phase**
*   **Stimulation:** Typically **immune stimulated** (require exposure through transfusion or pregnancy)
*   **Complement Activation:** Kidd antibodies are notorious for their ability to **bind complement effectively**. This contributes significantly to their ability to cause hemolysis, both *in vitro* (visible hemolysis in the test tube) and *in vivo*
*   **Dosage:** Often show **dosage**, meaning they react more strongly with cells from individuals who are homozygous for the antigen (e.g., anti-Jk<sup>a</sup> reacts stronger with Jk(a+b-) cells than Jk(a+b+) cells)
*   **Evanescence (The Treacherous Part!):** Kidd antibody titers can **decline rapidly** *in vivo* after initial stimulation, sometimes becoming undetectable in routine antibody screening tests between exposures. However, upon re-exposure (e.g., transfusion with antigen-positive blood), a rapid and strong **anamnestic response** can occur, leading to..
*   **Clinical Significance:** **HIGHLY Clinically Significant!**
    *   **Delayed Hemolytic Transfusion Reactions (DHTRs):** Kidd antibodies are a leading cause of DHTRs. The reaction typically occurs 3-14 days post-transfusion as the antibody level rapidly rises and destroys the transfused antigen-positive cells. Symptoms can range from mild (unexplained drop in hemoglobin, fever, jaundice) to severe (shock, renal failure)
    *   **Acute Hemolytic Transfusion Reactions:** While less common than DHTRs, potent Kidd antibodies can cause immediate HTRs
    *   **Hemolytic Disease of the Fetus and Newborn (HDFN):** Can cause HDFN, usually mild to moderate, but severe cases have been reported

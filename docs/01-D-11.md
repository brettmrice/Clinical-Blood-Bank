# Washed RBCs {-}

**Washed Red Blood Cells**, a modification performed on standard RBC units to remove the majority of the plasma and its constituents

## **What Are Washed Red Blood Cells?** {-}

*   **Definition:** Washed Red Blood Cells are RBC units that have undergone a procedure involving sequential additions of sterile isotonic saline (0.9% NaCl) followed by centrifugation and removal of the supernatant saline/plasma mixture. The final product consists of red blood cells suspended primarily in saline
*   **Goal:** To remove as much of the original plasma (and/or additive solution) as possible from the RBC unit

## **Preparation Method (The Washing Process)** {-}

1.  A unit of standard Red Blood Cells (usually Leukoreduced) is selected
2.  Using an automated cell washer or manual methods (less common), sterile 0.9% saline is added to the unit
3.  The unit is mixed and then centrifuged
4.  The supernatant fluid (saline mixed with the original plasma/additive solution) is expressed off and discarded
5.  Steps 2-4 are repeated multiple times (typically 2-3 wash cycles) to achieve significant removal of the original supernatant
6.  After the final wash, the RBCs are resuspended in a small volume of sterile 0.9% saline
7.  **Critical Point** This process typically involves connecting bags and tubing, often creating an **"open system"** which breaches the original sterility of the unit

## **Indications for Use (Why Wash RBCs?)** {-}

Washing is performed for specific clinical situations where the plasma component of the RBC unit is problematic for the recipient:

*   **Prevention of Severe Allergic Transfusion Reactions:** This is the **primary indication**
    *   Patients with a history of recurrent, severe allergic reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, severe urticaria, bronchospasm) attributed to plasma proteins in transfused blood
    *   Specifically indicated for patients with **IgA deficiency who have clinically significant anti-IgA antibodies**. Transfusing plasma containing IgA into these patients can trigger severe anaphylactic reactions. Washing removes the vast majority of IgA from the unit
*   **Prevention of Hyperkalemic Complications from Transfusion**
    *   Stored RBCs leak potassium (K+) into the supernatant. Older units can have very high supernatant K+ levels
    *   Washing removes this high-potassium supernatant
    *   Indicated for patients at high risk for adverse effects of a potassium load, such as:
        *   Neonates (especially premature infants receiving large-volume or exchange transfusions)
        *   Patients with pre-existing hyperkalemia or severe renal impairment undergoing large-volume or rapid transfusions
    *   *Note:* Using fresh RBCs (e.g., <7-10 days old) is often an alternative strategy to minimize potassium load

## **Storage and Expiration** {-}

This is a major limitation of washed RBCs:

*   **Storage Temperature:** **1째C to 6째C** (same as standard RBCs)
*   **Expiration:** Due to the washing process typically being performed in an **open system**, the risk of bacterial contamination is increased. Therefore, the expiration date is significantly shortened:
    *   **24 hours:** from the time the washing procedure is completed (when stored at 1-6째C)

## **Properties of Washed RBCs** {-}

Compared to standard RBC units, washed RBCs have:

*   **Minimal Plasma:** Most plasma proteins (including IgA, other antibodies, cytokines) are removed
*   **Minimal Additive Solution:** Any AS solution is also washed away
*   **Reduced Potassium:** Accumulated extracellular potassium is removed
*   **Reduced Leukocytes & Platelets:** The washing process also removes residual WBCs and platelets (though pre-storage leukoreduction is usually performed initially anyway)
*   **Slight RBC Loss:** The washing process inevitably causes some loss of red blood cells (typically around 10-20%)

## **Administration** {-}

*   **Compatibility:** Standard ABO/Rh typing and crossmatch procedures **are required**
*   **Filtration:** Administer through a standard blood filter (170-260 microns)
*   **Infusion Time:** Must be completed within **4 hours** of spiking the bag or removal from controlled 1-6째C storage (and well within the 24-hour post-wash expiration)

## **Advantages** {-}

*   **Prevents Severe Allergic Reactions:** Effectively removes plasma proteins responsible for anaphylaxis (especially IgA)
*   **Reduces Potassium Load:** Removes accumulated potassium, safer for susceptible patients receiving large/rapid transfusions
*   **Removes Other Plasma Constituents:** Can remove donor antibodies or cytokines (though leukoreduction is more targeted for cytokine removal)

## **Disadvantages** {-}

*   **Short Expiration (24 hours):** Major logistical challenge, requires washing close to the time of anticipated transfusion, increases wastage if not used
*   **Open System Risk:** Potential for bacterial contamination during processing
*   **Time-Consuming & Labor-Intensive:** Requires specialized equipment and staff time (approx. 30-60 minutes per unit)
*   **Costly:** Adds significant cost compared to standard RBC units
*   **RBC Loss:** Reduces the effective dose of RBCs delivered

## **Alternatives** {-}

*   For preventing allergic reactions in IgA deficient patients with anti-IgA: Using blood products from IgA deficient donors (very rare and difficult to source)
*   For reducing potassium load: Using fresh RBC units (<7-10 days old)

## **Key Terms** {-}

*   **Washing:** Process of removing plasma/supernatant from cellular components using saline exchange
*   **Supernatant:** The liquid portion surrounding the cells in a blood component unit
*   **IgA Deficiency:** Condition where an individual lacks Immunoglobulin A
*   **Anti-IgA:** Antibodies against IgA, found in some IgA-deficient individuals, capable of causing anaphylaxis upon exposure to IgA
*   **Hyperkalemia:** High levels of potassium in the blood
*   **Open System:** Processing method where the sterility of the component may be compromised, leading to shortened expiration
*   **Automated Cell Washer:** Equipment used to perform the washing procedure efficiently

Mendel’s Second Law: Law Independent Assortment\n* Concept: Alleles different traits (genes located different chromosomes far apart chromosome) inherited independently one another.\n* Blood Bank Relevance: inheritance ABO type (gene chromosome 9) independent RhD type (gene chromosome 1). Getting allele doesn’t make less likely get D allele.\n* Important Exception - Linkage: law doesn’t strictly apply genes located close together chromosome. called linked genes.3. Linked Genes Haplotypes\n* Concept: Genes physically close together chromosome tend inherited together block chance crossover (recombination) event happening meiosis low.\n* Haplotype: set linked alleles inherited together chromosome.\n* Blood Bank Relevance:\n* Rh System: RHD RHCE genes tightly linked chromosome 1. inherit block Rh alleles parent. example, common haplotype Caucasians DCe.
